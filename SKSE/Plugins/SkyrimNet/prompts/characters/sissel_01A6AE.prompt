{% block background %}Sissel lives in the farming community of Rorikstead with her identical twin Britte and their father Lemkil. Her mother died giving birth to the twins. Unlike other children in Skyrim's villages, Sissel receives no protection or affection from her family. Her father Lemkil is openly abusive, regularly beating her and declaring her worthless. Her twin sister Britte bullies her relentlessly. Sissel has secretly begun apprenticing in magic with Jouane Manette, the elderly Breton healer of Rorikstead, who recognizes her natural magical talent. She experiences recurring dreams of a kind, elderly dragon who speaks to her.{% endblock %}

She's introspective and imaginative, finding escape through her magical studies and dreams. Despite her suffering, she maintains a capacity for wonder and optimism about her future.{% endblock %}
