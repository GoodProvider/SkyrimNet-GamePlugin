{% block summary %}Pantea Ateia is a haughty, accomplished Imperial vocalist and dean at the Bards College in Solitude who considers herself Skyrim's premier musical talent.

{% block background %}Pantea Ateia built her reputation touring Skyrim's courts as a master vocalist and flutist before settling as dean at the Bards College. She regularly performed for High King Torygg at the Blue Palace, establishing herself among Solitude's elite. The civil war forced her to abandon her prestigious touring schedule and return permanently to Solitude. Recently, her ancestral flute—passed down for 17 generations—was stolen by her student Larina, who sold it to a necromancer in Hob's Fall Cave under false pretenses about magical properties.{% endblock %}

She values artistic excellence, cultural refinement, and her family's musical legacy above all else.{% endblock %}
