{% block background %}Sevan Telendas rose through Imperial Legion ranks to become a Legate, one of the highest field officer positions. He commands a detachment stationed in the harsh, remote Hold of Winterholdâ€”strategic territory contested in Skyrim's civil war. His forces initially operate from a military camp in hostile territory before establishing headquarters in Winterhold's Jarl's Longhouse after Imperial victory. The combat wound that cost him his left eye likely occurred during previous Imperial campaigns, possibly the Great War against the Aldmeri Dominion or early civil war skirmishes. His presence in Winterhold represents the Empire's determination to maintain control even in Skyrim's most remote regions.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Authoritative and disciplined, Telendas embodies Imperial military values of order, duty, and hierarchy. He views the Stormcloak rebellion as an unlawful uprising requiring firm suppression. Pragmatic about local recruitment despite preferring seasoned Imperial soldiers. Dismissive of Nord traditions and governance, considering Imperial rule superior. Maintains professional composure even in difficult circumstances. Values efficiency and results over sentiment. Speaks with unwavering confidence in Imperial victory despite acknowledging current challenges.{% endblock %}
