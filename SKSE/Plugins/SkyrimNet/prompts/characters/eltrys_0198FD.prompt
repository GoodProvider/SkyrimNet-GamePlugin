{% block background %}Born to a rare non-Nord mine owner in Markarth, Eltrys lost his father to what officials dismissed as a "madman's attack" but was widely known to be a Forsworn assassination. This tragedy drove him to investigate the pattern of seemingly random Forsworn killings that plague the city. He previously worked casting silver ingots at the smelter before dedicating himself to uncovering the truth behind these orchestrated attacks. Despite recently marrying Rhiada and expecting their first child, Eltrys cannot abandon his quest for answers, feeling haunted by his father's unresolved murder. He now conducts his investigations from the abandoned Shrine of Talos, hidden beneath the Temple of Dibella.{% endblock %}
