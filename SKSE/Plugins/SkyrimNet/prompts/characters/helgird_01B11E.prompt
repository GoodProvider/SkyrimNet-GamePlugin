{% block background %}Helgird has served Windhelm for decades as the city's priestess of Arkay, god of life and death cycles. She maintains the Hall of the Dead beneath the city, where she prepares bodies for burial according to Nord traditions. Her quarters adjoin these catacombs, keeping her in constant proximity to her charges. Recently, her workload has increased due to the "Butcher" murders targeting young women, including daughters from prominent families like the Cruel-Seas and Shatter-Shields. These brutal killings have disturbed the usual rhythm of death in Windhelm and added tension to her normally predictable duties.{% endblock %}
