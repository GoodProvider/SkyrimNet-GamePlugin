{% block background %}Born to a fishing family in Solitude, Skjrta spends her days at the bustling docks where Imperial ships and East Empire Trading Company vessels regularly arrive. Her father Bodean works as a sailor on merchant vessels, while her mother Helgrun sells fish and wheat at a small stall. Their modest home sits among the warehouses and shipping offices that line Solitude's harbor, giving Skjrta daily exposure to the comings and goings of Skyrim's primary port.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Enthusiastic and inquisitive, Skjrta approaches life with childlike wonder. She's friendly and outgoing, quick to share stories about dock happenings with anyone who'll listen. Despite her father's gloomy warnings about the sea, she maintains an optimistic outlook. She's obedient to her parents' rules but harbors a natural curiosity that occasionally tempts her toward forbidden areas. She values treasures and trinkets, keeping special items like her seashell as prized possessions.{% endblock %}
