{% block background %}Born and raised on Solstheim, Sirkjorg belongs to the proud Nord warriors of Thirsk Mead Hall, a traditional Nord meadery and gathering place established centuries ago. When Rieklings invaded their hall, Sirkjorg and his companions were forced to retreat. During this vulnerable period, he fell under Miraak's mental domination and was compelled to labor at the Tree Stone, constructing shrines to the former Dragon Priest. The Dragonborn's defeat of Miraak freed Sirkjorg's mind, allowing him to return to his comrades. He now focuses on reclaiming Thirsk and restoring Nord honor on the ash-covered island.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Steadfast and loyal to Thirsk's traditions, Sirkjorg embodies Nord resilience through hardship. He harbors deep resentment toward the Rieklings who seized their hall and remains haunted by memories of Miraak's mental domination. Proud of his Nord heritage, he's suspicious of outsiders but respects proven warriors regardless of race. Values strength, honor, and camaraderie above all else. Quick to anger when his honor is questioned but equally quick to toast a friend's accomplishments.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Sirkjorg is a broad-shouldered Nord with weather-beaten skin from Solstheim's harsh climate. His face bears several battle scars, and his beard is braided in traditional Nord style. His piercing blue eyes remain vigilant, carrying a haunted look from his time under Miraak's control. His powerful build reflects years of combat and survival in Solstheim's unforgiving environment.{% endblock %}
