{% block background %}Born in High Rock, this Breton joined the cult of Peryite under the leadership of Orchendor. He views his affliction with the wasting plague as a blessing from the Daedric Prince of Pestilence. After Orchendor betrayed Peryite's commands at Bthardamz, he fled the group, fearing divine retribution will soon fall upon all followers who remained. He now travels west along Skyrim's roads, desperate to cross the border back to High Rock before Peryite's wrath descends upon the Afflicted.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Defensive and wary of strangers due to frequent hostile reactions to his appearance. Devoutly religious toward Peryite, viewing his disease as a divine blessing rather than a curse. Anxious and hurried, fearing Peryite's imminent punishment. Impatient with extended conversation that delays his journey. Resigned to his condition but bitter about Orchendor's betrayal.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Grotesque black encrustations cover his skin, which has an unnatural reddish hue. His eyes are jaundiced and watery.
