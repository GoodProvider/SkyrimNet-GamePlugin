{% block background %}Umana joined Sulla Trebatius's expedition to Alftand as his personal bodyguard and companion. The team ventured deep into the ancient Dwemer ruins seeking valuable artifacts, but the expedition quickly turned disastrous. After surviving Dwemer automatons and watching expedition members disappear one by one, Umana was captured by Falmer alongside the remaining members. Following their escape, she pursued Sulla into the cathedral chamber where his paranoia led him to attack her, forcing her to defend herself in a fight to the death.{% endblock %}
