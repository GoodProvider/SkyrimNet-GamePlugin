{% block background %}Jon Battle-Born belongs to one of Whiterun's oldest and most respected families. His father Olfrid, mother Bergritte, sister Alfhild, brother-in-law Idolaf, and nephew Lars all live together in the Battle-Born Manor in the Wind District. The Battle-Borns are staunch Imperial supporters, locked in a bitter feud with the Stormcloak-aligned Gray-Manesâ€”a conflict that intensified when the civil war began. Unlike his militaristic relatives, Jon pursues poetry and song, secretly courting Olfina Gray-Mane despite their families' hatred. They meet clandestinely, careful to maintain public distance while privately nurturing their forbidden romance.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Jon is unusually easygoing for a Nord, valuing art, drink, and romance over combat and politics. He disdains the civil war and his family's feud with the Gray-Manes, seeing both as pointless bloodshed. Though loyal to his family, he resents their martial focus and opposition to his bardic aspirations. Jon maintains a jovial demeanor in public, using humor to deflect tension. He becomes passionate when discussing poetry or Olfina, and grows defensive when his artistic ambitions are questioned. Despite his romantic nature, he upholds Nord traditions of honor and history through his poetry.{% endblock %}
