{% block background %}Born and raised in the harsh climate of northern Skyrim, Njordr chose to remain near Winterhold despite its decline after the Great Collapse. He established his humble home by the docks, away from the college, preferring the company of fellow working Nords to mages. Over the years, he's developed intimate knowledge of local waters, hunting grounds, and weather patterns. With his wife Skadi, he's raised their daughter Gullveig, teaching her survival skills while supporting her interest in archery.{% endblock %}

He's protective of his family, generous with friends, and wary of strangers until they prove themselves trustworthy.{% endblock %}
