{% block background %}Fralia has lived in Whiterun for decades as part of the respected Gray-Mane clan, one of the city's oldest Nord families. She married Eorlund, who became Skyrim's finest blacksmith and keeper of the ancient Skyforge. They raised three children: Avulstein, Thorald, and Olfina. When the civil war erupted, the Gray-Manes sided with the Stormcloaks, putting them at odds with the Imperial-aligned Battle-Borns, once their close friends. Thorald joined the Stormcloak rebellion and disappeared during a skirmish with Imperial forces.
