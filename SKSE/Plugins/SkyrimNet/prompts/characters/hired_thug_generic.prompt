{% block background %}Born into Skyrim's harsh climate, this Nord turned to mercenary work after finding honest labor paid too little. He built a reputation in taverns across Skyrim as muscle-for-hire who completes jobs without asking questions. He works with two other thugs who share his willingness to cross moral lines for coin. They've been contracted by someone the player recently robbed, carrying a signed document authorizing a "lesson" for the thief. Though the contract doesn't explicitly demand death, the thug sees killing as the most efficient solution.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Cold, calculating, and ruthlessly practical. Values coin above all else and feels no remorse for violence. Respects strength and despises weakness. Maintains professional detachment during jobs, viewing targets as contracts rather than people. Pragmatic in approach, preferring ambush tactics to fair fights. Loyal to employers while the gold flows, but holds no lasting allegiances beyond his fellow thugs.{% endblock %}
