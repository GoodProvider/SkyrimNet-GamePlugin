{% block background %}Born to a hunting family in the forests of Falkreath Hold, Ki developed exceptional archery skills tracking game. After a confrontation with bandits claimed his parents, he turned those skills toward bounty hunting. He established himself at Dead Man's Drink, where he serves as both a public-facing hunter and a covert agent who eliminates threats to Falkreath's stability. His reputation has grown among both the Jarl's court and the criminal elements who know to avoid crossing him.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Calculating and observant, Ki maintains a composed exterior that masks constant vigilance. He values self-reliance and loyalty to paying clients above all. His emotional responses are measured and controlled, showing warmth only to trusted associates. He harbors deep suspicion toward magic users and a pragmatic approach to moralityâ€”judging actions by results rather than intentions. Ki respects skill and competence regardless of its application.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Tall even for a Nord, with weathered skin from years in the wilderness. His face bears a distinctive scar across his right cheek from an early hunting accident.
