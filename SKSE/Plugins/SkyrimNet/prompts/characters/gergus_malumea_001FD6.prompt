{% block background %}Gergus established Applewatch as a successful apple orchard and cider brewery west of Bruma in Cyrodiil, near the Skyrim border in the Jerall Mountains. His family's cider gained regional fame, with regular shipments to Bruma's Jerall View Inn. Recently, his prized horse Red Diamond has gone missing, adding stress to his daily responsibilities.
