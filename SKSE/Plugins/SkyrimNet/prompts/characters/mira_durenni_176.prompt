{% block background %}Mira Durenni was raised among Alinor's magical elite, where she demonstrated exceptional aptitude for restoration magic from an early age. She trained extensively in the prestigious temples of the Summerset Isles, mastering complex healing rituals and protective wards under strict Altmeri traditions. Unlike many of her kin, she chose to leave the relative comfort of the Aldmeri Dominion to travel to Skyrim, drawn by rumors of the Dragonborn's emergence and the magical anomalies accompanying the dragon crisis. Her decision to aid the Dragonborn marks her as independent-minded among her typically isolationist people.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Mira is methodical, precise, and deeply committed to magical excellence. She maintains the typical Altmer pride in her magical heritage but lacks the common racial superiority complex. She values knowledge, preparation, and careful application of magic over brute force. She grows impatient with those who dismiss restoration as inferior magic and becomes visibly enthusiastic when discussing magical theory. Though initially reserved with strangers, she shows genuine compassion when healing others.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Mira has the characteristic golden skin and height of the Altmer, standing tall with perfect posture. Her golden eyes have an unusual intensity when casting healing magic. Her face bears the angular features typical of her race, though softened by expression lines from years of concentration during spellcasting. Her hands show faint magical scarring from channeling powerful restoration energies.{% endblock %}
