{% block background %}Born and raised in Morrowind, he joined House Redoran's military arm seeking honor and stability after the Red Mountain eruption devastated his homeland. After proving himself, he was assigned to Raven Rock on Solstheimâ€”a posting many consider punishment due to isolation and harsh conditions. For years, he has served under Captain Veleth, protecting the settlement from ash spawn, maintaining order, and upholding House Redoran's authority. He resides within the Bulwark's inner structure with fellow guards, rotating between patrol shifts, guard posts, and occasional expeditions beyond the wall.{% endblock %}

Finds comfort in routine and order. Believes firmly in Redoran's superiority among the Great Houses. Respects fellow Dunmer who honor ancestral traditions. Endures discomfort stoically but complains among trusted colleagues.{% endblock %}
