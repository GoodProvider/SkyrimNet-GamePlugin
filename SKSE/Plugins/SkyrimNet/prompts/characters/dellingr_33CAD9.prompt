{% block background %}Born and raised in Winterhold, Dellingr witnessed the town's decline following the Great Collapse that destroyed most of the once-prosperous city. When the devastation drove many residents away, he recognized an opportunity to establish a stable business, as travelers still needed transportation through the harsh northern terrain. He acquired several hardy Palomino stallions, including his prized horses Sleipnir and Hrimfaxi, and founded Hoarfrost Stables with his wife Nott. Their business provides crucial transportation services for merchants, College visitors, and couriers braving the treacherous mountain passes.{% endblock %}
