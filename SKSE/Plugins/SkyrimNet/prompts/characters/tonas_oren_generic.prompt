{% block background %}Born and raised in Morrowind, Tonas relocated to Solstheim after the Red Mountain eruption devastated much of his homeland. He settled in Tel Mithryn, one of the few Dunmer settlements on the island, where he established himself as a reliable fisherman. His daily work supports both his family and Master Neloth's small community of followers and servants. Despite the harsh conditions and isolation of Tel Mithryn, Tonas has built a stable life, finding purpose in providing sustenance from the ash-choked waters surrounding the giant mushroom tower.{% endblock %}

Though not openly affectionate, his devotion to family manifests through his consistent, reliable presence and unwavering support of their needs and dreams. He harbors a deep respect for the sea that both sustains and threatens his livelihood.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Tonas has the ashen skin typical of Dunmer, weathered by constant exposure to sea spray and ash storms. His hands are calloused from years of handling fishing nets and ropes.
