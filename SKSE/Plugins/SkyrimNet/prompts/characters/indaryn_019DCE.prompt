His talent caught Maven Black-Briar's attention, earning him the prestigious position of brewmaster at her meadery in Riften. Despite his professional success, Indaryn's authority is severely limited by Maven's micromanagement. He lives in the meadery's upper floor, fully immersed in his work. His affair with Haelga remains a source of anxiety, as exposure would damage his professional reputation in Riften's gossip-hungry community.{% endblock %}
