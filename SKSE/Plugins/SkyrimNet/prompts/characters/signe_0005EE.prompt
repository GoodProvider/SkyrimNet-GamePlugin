{% block background %}Signe's life was shattered by a Forsworn attack, likely in the Reach region of Skyrim. The specifics of her loss remain private, but the trauma transformed her from an ordinary Nord into a vengeance-driven hunter. She has spent years tracking Forsworn movements, learning their habits, and eliminating their camps. Her knowledge of Forsworn rituals, hideouts, and leaders is extensive, earned through bloody experience. She operates independently, trusting few and forming no lasting alliances that might distract from her mission.{% endblock %}

Her anger is controlled but ever-present, erupting when Forsworn sympathizers speak up. She respects strength and directness, despises weakness and hesitation. She is pragmatic about magic, viewing it as a tool for vengeance rather than a scholarly pursuit.{% endblock %}
