{% block background %}Born to farmers in Hammerfell near the Alik'r Desert, Fironet grew up working the land while dreaming of distant places. Her grandmother, a Bards College graduate, inspired her musical aspirations by teaching her the lute. Fironet eventually left Hammerfell, traveling by ship from Lainlyn to Solitude with her fiancé, who later abandoned their engagement and returned home. She has spent several months in Solitude attempting to gain formal admission to the Bards College while establishing connections at the Winking Skeever tavern.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Skittish and deeply insecure, Fironet habitually undermines her own progress through fear of failure. She creates safety nets and excuses before taking risks, leading to perpetual stagnation in her bardic training. Despite her anxieties, she possesses genuine wanderlust and curiosity about the world. She values connection and has built a modest social network in Solitude. When performing, she briefly overcomes her insecurities, showing glimpses of the confident bard she aspires to become.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Fironet has the dark skin and curly black hair typical of Redguards, with expressive eyes that betray her nervousness. Her hands show calluses from both farm work and lute playing. She carries herself with the slightly hunched posture of someone trying to appear smaller and less noticeable in unfamiliar surroundings.{% endblock %}
