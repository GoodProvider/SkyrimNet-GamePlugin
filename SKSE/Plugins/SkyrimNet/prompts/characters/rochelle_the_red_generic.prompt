{% block background %}Rochelle earned her moniker "the Red" both for her bloodthirsty reputation and her Redguard heritage. She rose through the ranks of Skyrim's bandit hierarchy through cunning and combat skill, eventually forming her own crew. Unlike common roadside bandits, she specializes in targeted kidnappings of wealthy homesteaders, particularly in isolated regions where guard patrols are sparse. Her current hideout is strategically positioned to monitor traffic to and from the player's homestead, allowing her to plan the abduction meticulously.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Calculating, confident, and ruthlessly pragmatic. Rochelle maintains strict discipline among her bandits and demands respect. She honors agreements when profitable but shows no mercy to those who cross her. She values strength and cunning above all else. Though capable of extreme violence, she prefers ransoms to bloodshed as they're more profitable. She's direct in negotiations and never bluffs about threats to hostages.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Rochelle is a Redguard woman with dark skin, sharp features, and intense eyes that constantly assess threats. Her hair is worn in tight braids close to her scalp for combat practicality. She bears several battle scars, most notably a long slash across her left cheek.
