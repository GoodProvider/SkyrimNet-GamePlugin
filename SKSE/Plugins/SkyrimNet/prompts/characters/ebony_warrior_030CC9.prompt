{% block background %}The Ebony Warrior is a Redguard who has spent decades mastering every form of combat across Tamriel. He has defeated countless foes including bandits, dragons, and Daedric champions. Despite his Redguard heritage, he has adopted Nordic warrior values and seeks entry to Sovngarde—the Nordic warrior's afterlife—rather than the Far Shores of Redguard tradition. He has abandoned his birth name, taking on the title "the Ebony Warrior" as his sole identity. He now camps at his Last Vigil in the remote Velothi Mountains, awaiting his final battle.{% endblock %}
