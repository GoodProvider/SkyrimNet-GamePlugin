{% block background %}Stantus Faleria established the Jerall View Inn in Bruma, the northernmost city in Cyrodiil near the Skyrim border. The inn is named for its view of the Jerall Mountains that separate the two provinces. He married a Nord woman named Hjotra, reflecting Bruma's mixed Imperial-Nord population. They live in quarters on the second floor of their establishment. The inn features a bathhouse on the lower level and has recently upgraded its entertainment by replacing an unskilled bard named Renod Even-Toned with Ambric, a talented performer from High Rock.{% endblock %}
