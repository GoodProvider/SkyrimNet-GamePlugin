{% block background %}Born and raised in Black Marsh, Swims-In-Deep-Water developed exceptional fishing skills in the swamps of his homeland before migrating to Skyrim. His natural Argonian affinity for water made him perfectly suited for a life on Lake Honrich. Over decades of work, he rose to become Riften's master angler, eventually writing the definitive "Fishing Mastery" five-volume series. His expertise earned him management of the Riften Fishery, where he now trains the next generation of anglers. He acquired the Fang of Haynekhtnamet during his travels, recognizing its historical significance to Argonian culture.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Swims-In-Deep-Water has dark green scales with blue-gray accents along his spine and tail. His eyes are amber with vertical slits.
