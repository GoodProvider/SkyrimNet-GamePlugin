{% block background %}Morven was a prominent merchant who traveled throughout High Rock, known for his rare goods and shrewd deals. His downfall came when he unknowingly sold counterfeit ingredients to a necromancer's associate. The vengeful necromancer soul-trapped him and his entire caravan, sending Morven to the Soul Cairn. He arrived complete with his wagon and merchandise, which he still guards possessively. Unlike most souls who wander aimlessly in despair, Morven adapted by establishing himself as the Soul Cairn's only merchant, trading soul husks for his remaining inventory.{% endblock %}
