{% block background %}Born and raised on the isolated isle of Roscrea northeast of Skyrim, Leona was steeped in traditional Nord culture untainted by Imperial influence.

Between missions, she funds her resistance by clearing bandit camps and exploring ancient Nordic ruins.{% endblock %}

Despite her serious mission, she maintains the traditional Nord appreciation for good mead, rousing songs, and tests of strength.{% endblock %}
