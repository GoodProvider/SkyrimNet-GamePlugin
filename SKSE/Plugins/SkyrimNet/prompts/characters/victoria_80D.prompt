{% block background %}Victoria has served at the Blue Palace for over a decade, witnessing the transition of power from High King Torygg to Jarl Elisif the Fair after Ulfric's challenge. Her position has given her unique insight into the inner workings of Solitude's court and the political machinations of Skyrim's nobility. Before her service at court, she traveled extensively through the province, experiencing firsthand the harsh realities faced by common folk across the holds. These experiences shaped her worldview, tempering idealism with pragmatism.{% endblock %}

She harbors a subtle bias against those who wield power carelessly and respects those who shoulder responsibility with grace.{% endblock %}
