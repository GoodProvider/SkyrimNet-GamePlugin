{% block background %}Born in Morrowind before relocating to Solstheim after the Red Mountain eruption. Turned to banditry after failing to establish legitimate work in the harsh conditions of the ash wastes. Now part of a reaver band operating from an abandoned fort in southern Solstheim, conducting raids on travelers, miners, and small settlements. Has a bounty in Raven Rock and cannot enter the settlement without risk of arrest. Previously spent time in prison, which hardened their resolve to avoid capture at all costs.{% endblock %}

Deeply distrustful of authority figures and non-Dunmer. Harbors resentment toward more successful Dunmer, especially House Redoran officials. Practical about survival, willing to flee rather than die in a losing battle. Drinks heavily when supplies allow. Nostalgic about Morrowind's past glory while bitter about current circumstances.{% endblock %}
