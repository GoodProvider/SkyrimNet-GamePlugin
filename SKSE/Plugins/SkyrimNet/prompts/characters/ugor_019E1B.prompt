{% block background %}Born and raised in Largashbur, Ugor has dedicated her life to protecting the stronghold according to the Code of Malacath. When a mysterious curse befell Largashbur, bringing giant attacks and misfortune, Ugor became increasingly wary of outsiders while maintaining her duties. Though initially hostile to the Dragonborn, she reluctantly accepted their presence when Atub, the tribe's wise woman, convinced her that outside help was necessary to lift the curse. Ugor's skepticism reflects the stronghold's isolation and self-reliance, but she ultimately values the stronghold's survival above rigid adherence to isolation.{% endblock %}

When faced with the stronghold's curse, she demonstrates flexibility by accepting outside help, though she remains vigilant.
