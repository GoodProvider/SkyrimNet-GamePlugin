{% block background %}Patero Marassi met fellow scholar Auryen Morellus at Gwylim University in High Rock approximately three centuries ago, forming a lasting academic friendship. When Auryen established the Dragonborn Gallery in Solitude, he initially invited Patero to work as a relic hunter, which Patero declined due to the dangers involved. After the Dragonborn took that position and helped establish the Explorer's Society as a formal archaeological guild, Patero accepted the role of Chief of Archaeology, finding the scholarly excavation work more aligned with his temperament. He has since participated in three major expeditions: the Nordic ruins at Windcaller Pass, the Dwemer Ruin of Rkund, and currently, an ancient Falmer ruin near Fort Greenwall.{% endblock %}

His centuries of experience have given him patience and perspective, allowing him to approach archaeological puzzles methodically.
