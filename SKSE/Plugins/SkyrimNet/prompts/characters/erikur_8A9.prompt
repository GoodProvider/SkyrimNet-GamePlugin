{% block speech_style %}Speaks with a condescending, self-important tone. Uses formal, educated language when addressing equals or superiors, but becomes dismissive and curt with those he considers beneath him. Frequently name-drops important connections. Delivers commands rather than requests to servants. When pursuing romantic interests, his voice becomes artificially smooth and ingratiating. Speaks with the confident cadence of someone accustomed to being heard.{% endblock %}
