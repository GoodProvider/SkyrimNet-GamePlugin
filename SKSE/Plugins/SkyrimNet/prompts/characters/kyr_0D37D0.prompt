His band discovered the ancient Nordic ruin contained a legendary weapon - the Pale Blade. While exploring deeper sections of the crypt, his subordinate Ra'jirr, a Khajiit driven by greed, betrayed and ambushed him for possession of the blade, leaving him with a mortal wound in a forested section of the crypt.{% endblock %}
