{% block background %}Born to a family of subsistence hunters and fishers, Gullveig has grown up in the harsh climate of Winterhold, one of Skyrim's most remote and coldest regions. Her family maintains one of the few occupied houses near the dilapidated wooden docks, surviving where many others abandoned the area after the Great Collapse. While not from a wealthy family, she has learned practical survival skills essential to life in northern Skyrim. She regularly visits Winterhold proper, particularly the archery range near the ancient statue of Jhunal, the Nordic god of hermetic orders and mathematics.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Resilient and independent, Gullveig possesses typical Nord stubbornness and pride in her heritage. She's practical and resourceful from growing up in harsh conditions, with a curious mind that draws her to both archery practice and the mysterious College looming above town. She maintains a cheerful disposition despite Winterhold's bleakness, though harbors the typical Nord's suspicion of magic and outsiders. She balances youthful enthusiasm with the early maturity forced upon children in Skyrim's unforgiving environments.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Gullveig has dirty blonde hair typical of many Nords, with a complexion weathered slightly beyond her years from constant exposure to Winterhold's harsh elements. Her face shows the characteristic strong Nord features, and her hands are already developing calluses from regular bow practice and helping with her parents' work.{% endblock %}

- Become skilled enough with a bow to hunt independently and contribute more to her family
- Visit other holds in Skyrim, particularly Whiterun which she hears has the finest archery merchants
