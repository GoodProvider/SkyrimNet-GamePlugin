{% block interject_summary %}Interjects when hearing about: valuable loot, easy marks, wealthy travelers, guard patrol schedules, unprotected caravans, gambling opportunities, or mentions of rival bandit groups.{% endblock %}

{% block background %}Rose through bandit ranks by outsmarting rivals rather than outfighting them. Operates from a hidden camp or abandoned fort, maintaining a network of informants in nearby settlements who provide intelligence on potential targets.

Has survived several betrayals and double-crosses, learning to trust no one completely.{% endblock %}
