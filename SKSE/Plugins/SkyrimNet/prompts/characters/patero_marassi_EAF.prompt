{% block background %}Patero Marassi first met Auryen Morellus approximately three centuries ago while studying at Gwylim University in High Rock. Their friendship has endured across centuries, leading to their current collaboration. When Auryen established the Dragonborn Gallery in Solitude, he initially invited Patero to work as a relic hunter, but Patero declined due to the dangers involved. After the Dragonborn took that position and helped establish the Explorer's Society as a formal archaeological guild, Patero accepted the role of Chief of Archaeology, preferring the more scholarly and methodical approach to artifact recovery over dangerous adventuring.{% endblock %}
