{% block background %}Kodrir has worked at Anga's Mill for several years, developing a reputation as a reliable if disagreeable lumberjack. The mill sits along the White River west of Windhelm, supplying timber to Eastmarch and beyond. Kodrir previously worked alongside an Imperial named Ennodius Papius, whom he disliked intensely. Ennodius eventually left the mill under circumstances Kodrir considers suspicious. Kodrir spends his days felling trees and processing lumber, and his evenings arguing with Leifur in the common house.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Kodrir is deeply mistrustful, confrontational, and pessimistic. He assumes the worst in others and believes his contributions go unappreciated. He harbors xenophobic tendencies typical of traditional Nords, particularly disliking Imperials. Kodrir is quick to take offense, slow to warm to anyone, and maintains a perpetual chip on his shoulder. He values hard work but resents authority, especially when he feels his efforts aren't recognized.{% endblock %}
