{% block background %}Etienne operates as a skilled infiltrator for the Thieves Guild in Riften.

Captured in Riften and transported to the Thalmor Embassy near Solitude, he endured extensive torture but revealed minimal information. His imprisonment left him with physical and psychological scars, but strengthened his resolve against authority figures. After his rescue, he returned to the Thieves Guild, where he continues his work with renewed caution and a deep gratitude toward his rescuer.{% endblock %}
