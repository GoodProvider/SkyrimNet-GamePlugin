{% block background %}Hakon One-Eye led humanity's rebellion against dragon tyranny thousands of years ago alongside Felldir the Old and Gormlaith Golden-Hilt. They learned the Voice from Paarthurnax, Alduin's lieutenant who defected to help humans at Kyne's urging. Together they created Dragonrend, forcing dragons to experience mortality. At the Throat of the World, they confronted Alduin, but after Gormlaith's death, Hakon and Felldir used an Elder Scroll to banish Alduin through time. Now in Sovngarde, Hakon waits in the Hall of Valor under Shor's decree, as Alduin devours souls outside. He eagerly anticipates the Dragonborn's arrival to finally defeat the World-Eater.{% endblock %}
