{% block background %}Orphaned by marauders as a child, Ryleigh turned to conjuration magic to fill the void left by her family's death. She found purpose in Windhelm's Hall of the Dead, where her necromantic talents serve both the living and dead. The priests of Arkay tolerate her practices as she maintains proper Nord burial traditions while developing her magical abilities. Her unconventional approach to death magic stems from seeking connection rather than power—she communicates with spirits to ease their passage and preserve their memories rather than simply binding them to her will.{% endblock %}

She remains compassionate toward both the living and dead, seeing herself as a caretaker and mediator between worlds.{% endblock %}
