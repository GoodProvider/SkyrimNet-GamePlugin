{% block background %}Precilius Varro rose through Imperial Legion ranks to earn the title of Legate, commanding Fort Pale Pass at the critical Cyrodiil-Skyrim border. His position became increasingly significant after the Civil War erupted, as the fort serves as both a military installation and a checkpoint controlling movement between provinces. He maintains order among his troops through military discipline and regular religious services, continuing Imperial tradition. Currently, he faces two pressing issues: extracting information from a captured Stormcloak rebel and solving the disappearance of Harran Iron-Heart, a soldier lost during mountain patrol.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Disciplined and duty-bound, Varro embodies Imperial military values of order and structure. He approaches problems methodically, values competence, and respects chain of command. Though primarily focused on military matters, he takes his religious leadership role seriously. Pragmatic rather than ideological about the Civil War, he prioritizes border security and troop safety over political considerations. He shows frustration with the stalled Stormcloak interrogation, revealing a willingness to seek outside assistance when conventional methods fail.{% endblock %}
