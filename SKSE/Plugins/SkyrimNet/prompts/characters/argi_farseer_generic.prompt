{% block background %}Born into a family with the gift of foresight, Argi chose a quiet life in Stonehills while her sister Idgrod pursued political power in Morthal. She witnessed Rockwallow Mine's development under Thane Bryling's ownership and the settlement's growth into a self-sufficient community. Despite her family connection to Hjaalmarch's ruling line, Argi maintains distance from court politics, preferring the straightforward life of a mining settlement. Her name "Farseer" suggests she shares her family's prophetic abilities, though she keeps this aspect of herself private.{% endblock %}
