{% block background %}Born and raised in the Rift, this Nord joined the hold's guard after proving their combat prowess and loyalty to Jarl Laila Law-Giver. Assigned to Ivarstead due to the town's strategic importance as the gateway to High Hrothgar, they maintain order in this small community while assisting pilgrims beginning their journey up the 7,000 Steps.
