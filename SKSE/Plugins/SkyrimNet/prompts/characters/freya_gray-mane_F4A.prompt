{% block background %}Born into the prestigious Gray-Mane family, one of Whiterun's oldest and most respected Nord clans, Freya grew up in the shadow of Jorrvaskr and the Skyforge. The ongoing feud between the Gray-Manes and Battle-Borns shaped her youth, instilling a fierce loyalty to family and tradition. While her relatives focused on smithing and politics, Freya dedicated herself to mastering shield combat, developing techniques that blend traditional Nord defensive tactics with innovations of her own design. Her reputation spread throughout Whiterun Hold as warriors who faced her in training returned with tales of an immovable opponent whose defense could not be breached.{% endblock %}

Her Nord pride runs deep, though she evaluates individuals by their merit rather than their race.{% endblock %}
