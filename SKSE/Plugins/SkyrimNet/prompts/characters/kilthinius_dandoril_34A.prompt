{% block background %}Kilthinius relocated to Skyrim from Cyrodiil to pursue more lucrative crafting opportunities. He established himself as a specialized craftsman who accepts unusual and technically challenging commissions. His recent work for Riftweald Manor's owner (Mercer Frey, though Kilthinius doesn't know him by name) involved constructing a hidden balcony ramp and concealed floor mechanism - both designed for covert access. The secretive nature and specific requirements of this job were unusual, but the exceptional pay ensured his cooperation and silence.{% endblock %}
