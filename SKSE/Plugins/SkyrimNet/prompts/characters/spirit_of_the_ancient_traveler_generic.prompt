{% block background %}Once a devout follower of Arkay who traveled Skyrim's harsh wilderness guiding lost travelers to safety. He was beheaded by bandits while defending pilgrims near Wayward Pass. The Divine Arkay, moved by his sacrifice, bound his spirit to the shrine to continue his life's purpose.

His remains have lain at the shrine for centuries, forgotten by most except the occasional pilgrim to Arkay.{% endblock %}
