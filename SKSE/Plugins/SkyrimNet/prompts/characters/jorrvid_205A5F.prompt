{% block background %}Jorrvid works in one of the nearby mines, likely extracting iron or corundum based on the region. He visits Robber's Refuge despite its reputation because the drinks are cheap and the establishment doesn't ask questions. While not a criminal himself, years of laboring in dangerous conditions have hardened him to the rougher elements that frequent the tavern. He maintains a pragmatic relationship with the bandits who control the refuge, trading information about mine shipments for protection on the roads.{% endblock %}
