{% block background %}Born to privilege as the eldest son of Jarl Laila Law-Giver, Harrald was raised in Mistveil Keep with expectations of eventually ruling Riften. He embraced Nord traditionalism and the Stormcloak cause early, seeing it as both politically advantageous and aligned with his nationalistic views. While his mother maintains a veneer of neutrality in public despite her Stormcloak sympathies, Harrald makes no effort to hide his contempt for the Empire and those loyal to it. The civil war has created a bitter divide between him and his brother Saerlund, who openly supports the Empire.{% endblock %}
