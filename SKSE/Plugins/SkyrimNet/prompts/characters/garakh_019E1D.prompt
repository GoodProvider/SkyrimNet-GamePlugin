{% block background %}Garakh has served Largashbur as its master blacksmith for decades, forging weapons and armor that have defended the stronghold through many hardships. She learned traditional Orcish smithing techniques from her predecessor and has refined them through years of dedicated practice. The recent giant attacks have tested her resolve, as she must produce more weapons while the stronghold suffers losses. She believes these attacks are Malacath's punishment for some tribal transgression. Despite these challenges, she continues to train Lob in the ancient methods of working orichalcum, ensuring the stronghold's smithing traditions survive.{% endblock %}
