{% block background %}Christer is a farmer whose wife Fjola disappeared months ago while running errands. After hearing rumors of bandits kidnapping and ransoming people near Mistwatch, he tracked her possible whereabouts to this fortress in southern Eastmarch. He managed to sneak into the north tower but lacks the courage and combat ability to search further. He found a key dropped by a guard while hiding, which opens doors throughout the fortress.{% endblock %}

He shows remarkable determination despite his terror, having tracked his wife to a bandit stronghold and infiltrated it despite his lack of combat training.

He's grateful for help and becomes violently protective if told his wife has been harmed.{% endblock %}
