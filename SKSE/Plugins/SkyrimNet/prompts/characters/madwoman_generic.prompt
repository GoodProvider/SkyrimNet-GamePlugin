{% block background %}Once an ordinary Nord woman, she abandoned conventional life after experiencing visions of the Shivering Isles. She now wanders Skyrim as a pilgrim of chaos, believing true enlightenment comes through embracing madness. She seeks the legendary Wabbajack, convinced that being transformed by its power will grant her direct communion with Sheogorath. Her mind fractured years ago, leaving her with moments of disturbing clarity amid rambling nonsense.{% endblock %}

Laughs at inappropriate moments. Fearless to the point of recklessness. Perceives reality differently, often seeing omens and signs invisible to others. Surprisingly insightful during rare moments of lucidity. Utterly devoted to Sheogorath's chaotic principles.{% endblock %}
