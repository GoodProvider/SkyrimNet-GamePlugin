{% block background %}Born in Hammerfell, Thurlan migrated to Skyrim seeking opportunity in the trading business. He established his food stall in Markarth years ago, surviving the city's political upheavals and Forsworn conflicts. His blindness in one eye came from a Forsworn ambush on a supply caravan he accompanied from Whiterun. Despite this injury, he built a reputation as a reliable merchant who sources quality goods from farms in the Reach and imports specialty items from other holds.{% endblock %}

Wary of strangers due to Markarth's political tensions, he warms considerably to regular customers.
