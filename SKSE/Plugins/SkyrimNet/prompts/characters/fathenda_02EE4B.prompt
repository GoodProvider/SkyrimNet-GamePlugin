{% block background %}Born with the natural magical affinity common to Bretons, Fathenda channeled her talents into alchemy rather than traditional spellcasting. She established her apothecary in Heljarchen to serve travelers on the major east-west road and locals from the surrounding area. Her shop's proximity to the small lake provides convenient access to water-based ingredients, while the varied terrain of The Pale—from pine forests to rocky hills—offers diverse flora for her formulas. She maintains a working relationship with Hadring at Nightgate Inn, supplying him with remedies for weary travelers while gathering news from his patrons.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Practical and resourceful, Fathenda approaches problems with a methodical alchemist's mindset. She values knowledge and fair trade, offering honest prices for quality goods. Her Breton heritage gives her pride in her magical craftsmanship. She's sociable but observant, preferring to listen before speaking. Years of living in the harsh climate of The Pale have made her resilient and self-reliant, though she maintains a warm demeanor with regular customers. She's skeptical of grand claims without evidence—a trait that serves her well in separating genuine ingredients from fraudulent ones.{% endblock %}
