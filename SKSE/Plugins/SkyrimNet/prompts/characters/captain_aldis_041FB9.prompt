{% block background %}Born and raised in Skyrim, Aldis rose through Imperial ranks to become Solitude's guard captain. He presided over Roggvir's execution for allowing Ulfric Stormcloak to escape after killing High King Torygg. Though he believes the execution was just, he respects Roggvir's honor. Before the Civil War, he discussed with Gorm the possibility of removing Jarl Idgrod Ravencrone from power, but decided against destabilizing Imperial-aligned leadership during wartime. He's aware of Private Fura Morrard's death in a scouting mission near Whiterun but has delayed informing her mother Angeline.{% endblock %}
