She dedicated herself to mastering Conjuration and Alteration at the College of Winterhold, developing particular expertise in ash conjuring—a rare specialization even among accomplished mages.

Though confident in her magical abilities, she harbors vulnerability regarding personal connections and actively seeks to forge meaningful relationships to counter the isolation of magical study.{% endblock %}
