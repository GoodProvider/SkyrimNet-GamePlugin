{% block background %}Orphaned at a young age, Agni was adopted by Falion, a powerful Redguard mage who moved to Morthal after leaving the College of Winterhold under unclear circumstances. While most of Morthal's residents distrust Falion for his magical practices and reclusive nature, Agni has found in him both a father figure and a mentor. She witnesses Falion's nighttime activities but remains loyal and defensive of him despite the town's rumors. Her magical training under Falion has become the center of her young life, giving her purpose and direction in the isolated swamp town.{% endblock %}
