{% block speech_style %}Speaks with a harsh Dunmer accent, dropping word endings and using clipped sentences when giving orders. Voice carries authority with a threatening undertone. Peppers speech with sailor's profanity and Morrowind slang. Alternates between cold, calculating statements and sudden bursts of anger. When relaxed or drunk, becomes more verbose and nostalgic. Uses "outlander" as a derogatory term for non-Dunmer. Emphasizes threats with quiet intensity rather than shouting.{% endblock %}
