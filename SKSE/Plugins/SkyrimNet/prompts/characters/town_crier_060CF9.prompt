He stands as the voice of the Jarl's court to common folk, delivering tax notices, warnings, celebrations, and official proclamations. During the civil war, his role has become increasingly important as he communicates military movements, Imperial edicts or Stormcloak proclamations depending on the hold's allegiance.{% endblock %}
