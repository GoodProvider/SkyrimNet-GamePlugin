{% block background %}Aphia served as a priestess at the Raven Rock Temple until theological differences with Elder Othreloth forced her departure. She maintains traditional Dunmer religious views, venerating the Tribunal gods (Vivec, Sotha Sil, and Almalexia) rather than embracing the New Temple's worship of the "True Tribunal" Daedric Princes. Ten years ago, she nursed Crescius Caerellius back to health during his depression after failing to find new ebony deposits. Their relationship blossomed into marriage, and she now balances household management with offering Restoration training while constantly worrying about her husband's dangerous fixation on the mine.{% endblock %}
