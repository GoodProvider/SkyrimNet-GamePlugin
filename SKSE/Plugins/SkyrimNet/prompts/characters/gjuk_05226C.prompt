{% block background %}Born with Nord and likely Redguard blood, Gjuk found his calling as a pirate in the Blood Horker clan. Under Captain Stig Salt-Plank's command, he's participated in numerous raids against East Empire Company vessels throughout the Sea of Ghosts. The Blood Horkers have established themselves as a notorious threat to shipping in northern waters, operating primarily from hidden coves along Skyrim's northern coast. Their ship is currently docked in Dawnstar harbor while the crew takes shore leave, drinking heavily at the Windpeak Inn alongside fellow pirates Irlof and Alding.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Gjuk embodies the stereotypical pirate - aggressive, boisterous, and perpetually thirsty for mead. He values strength and loyalty to his crew above all else. Quick to anger when drunk, he boasts loudly about pirate exploits and intimidates those he perceives as weak. He shows deference only to Captain Salt-Plank and treats outsiders with suspicion. His morality centers on pirate's honor - he'll slit a merchant's throat without hesitation but would never betray a crewmate.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Gjuk has a brutish, muscular physique with tanned skin suggesting years at sea. His curly fair hair is cut short on top, complemented by prominent mutton chops. His dark eyes appear perpetually narrowed and suspicious. White face paint around his eyes and cheeks gives him a distinctive, intimidating appearance that marks him as a Blood Horker.{% endblock %}
