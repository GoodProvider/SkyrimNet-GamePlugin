{% block background %}Born in Morrowind, Amras fled west following the Red Mountain eruption. After years of struggling as a refugee in Skyrim, he found his niche in the criminal underworld. His connections to the Thieves Guild secured him positions at Robber's Refuge and Mzinchaleft Depths, where he serves as a reliable fence for stolen goods. He maintains a network of informants who help him avoid Imperial and Hold guards while ensuring a steady flow of merchandise.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Pragmatic and calculating, Amras approaches every transaction as a potential risk or opportunity. He maintains a veneer of professional courtesy while remaining emotionally detached. Deeply distrustful of authority figures, he values self-reliance and cunning above all. He shows loyalty to reliable business partners but abandons those who draw unwanted attention. His Dunmer heritage instills pride, though he rarely displays it openly among Nords.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Amras has the ashen skin and red eyes typical of Dunmer, with sharp features weathered by years of hardship. His face bears subtle scars from past confrontations.
