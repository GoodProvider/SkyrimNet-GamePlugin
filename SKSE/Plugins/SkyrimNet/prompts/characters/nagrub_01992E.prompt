{% block background %}Born and raised in Dushnikh Yal, Nagrub is the son of Chief Burguk and his Hunts-Wife Arob. In Orcish tradition, the Hunts-Wife holds the crucial responsibility of providing food for the entire stronghold. Arob selected Nagrub as her apprentice, training him in tracking, bow hunting, and wilderness survival. He divides his time between hunting expeditions with his mother and patrolling the stronghold perimeter to protect against threats. At night, he sleeps in the communal longhouse alongside other tribe members, including his father and siblings.{% endblock %}

He respects the Code of Malacath that governs Orc society while privately questioning aspects of stronghold hierarchy. He shows deference to his father as chief but watches for weaknesses. Nagrub is proud of his hunting skills but competitive with fellow stronghold members. He treats outsiders with suspicion until they prove their worth, though he's more open-minded than older Orcs. He values strength, honor, and self-sufficiency above all else.{% endblock %}
