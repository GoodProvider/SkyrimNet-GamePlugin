{% block background %}Born into Skyrim's criminal underworld, Ri'Sa honed her skills as an assassin through years of blood and deception. Her reputation grew until she secured a contract to eliminate both leaders of the Civil War—Ulfric Stormcloak and General Tullius—in a single operation that would have reshaped Skyrim's political landscape. A dragon attack disrupted her meticulously planned assassination, leaving her with unfinished business and a personal vendetta against the dragon that interfered. She now travels with her cousin Tali and a mutual friend, pursuing both the dragon and potentially resuming her interrupted contract.{% endblock %}

She possesses a dry, sly humor that emerges unexpectedly. Ri'Sa values intelligence over brute strength and believes survival belongs to the clever rather than the powerful. She maintains emotional distance from most people, using charm and wit as tools rather than genuine connection. Her moral code revolves around contract fulfillment and loyalty to her chosen few rather than conventional ethics.{% endblock %}
