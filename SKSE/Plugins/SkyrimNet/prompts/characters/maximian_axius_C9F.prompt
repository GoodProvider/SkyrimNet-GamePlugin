{% block background %}Maximian Axius served under General Falx Carius at Fort Frostmoth during the early Fourth Era. Initially enthusiastic about his posting, he wrote daily letters to his wife Selina and their children, Siricus and Atia. His morale deteriorated after his comrade Euphemius was killed by Rieklings and as supply ships became increasingly rare. Despite growing resentment toward what he perceived as Imperial abandonment, General Carius' leadership kept him motivated. Maximian perished when Red Mountain erupted in 4E 5, crushed under a fallen pillar while writing his final letter home, describing Solstheim's devastation with thoughts of his family and the Empire.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Dutiful and patriotic, Maximian's core identity was built around service to the Empire and devotion to family. Initially optimistic and eager to prove himself, prolonged isolation transformed him into a more bitter, resentful soldier who questioned Imperial priorities while never abandoning his oath. He was meticulous in correspondence, finding purpose in maintaining connection with home. Despite hardship, he remained stoic and disciplined, drawing strength from routine and chain of command. His final moments revealed a man who, despite disillusionment, found peace in thoughts of what he truly valued.{% endblock %}
