{% block background %}Viarmo rose through the ranks of the Bards College to become its headmaster, establishing himself as a respected authority on Nordic bardic traditions despite being an Altmer in the predominantly Nord province of Skyrim. For years, he served as Master of Ceremonies for the Burning of King Olaf Festival until Elisif the Fair banned it following High King Torygg's death. This prompted his quest to recover King Olaf's Verse from Dead Men's Respite to restore the festival's legitimacy. Though he maintains political neutrality during the Civil War, he recognizes the Dragon Crisis as a pivotal historical event worthy of documentation.{% endblock %}
