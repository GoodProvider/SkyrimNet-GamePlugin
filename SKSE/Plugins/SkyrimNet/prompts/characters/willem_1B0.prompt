{% block background %}Willem belongs to the native Reachmen who have inhabited the Reach for centuries before Nordic conquest. He works at Left Hand Mine, an iron mining operation near Markarth built among ancient Dwemer ruins. The mine sits across a tributary of the Karth River from Markarth, connected by several stone bridges. Recently, the nearby Kolskeggr Mine suffered a brutal Forsworn attack, with survivors Pavo and Gat taking refuge in Willem's barracks, heightening tensions in the area.{% endblock %}

Willem avoids political discussions but holds deep pride in his Reachman heritage.{% endblock %}
