{% block background %}Janus comes from an Imperial family that settled in Skyrim eighty years ago. He grew up in Riften with his wife Veresa, where they witnessed the Black-Briar family's corrupt influence firsthand. Seeking a better life away from Riften's criminal elements, they relocated to Rorikstead several years ago and established Farmer's Bounty Mercantile.
