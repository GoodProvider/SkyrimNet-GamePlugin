{% block summary %}Ruki is a Nord ghost who believes she is still alive, desperately searching for her lover Fenrig among the fallen soldiers at Gjukar's Monument.

{% block background %}Ruki was in love with Fenrig, a Nord soldier who served in Gjukar's army. When she heard the army was defeated in battle at what is now Gjukar's Monument in Whiterun Hold, she traveled there to find him. She died during her search, likely from exposure or bandits, but her spirit remains bound to the site. Her ghost has continued searching for centuries, trapped in a moment of desperate hope, unable to accept either Fenrig's death or her own.{% endblock %}
