{% block background %}Benkum serves on a merchant vessel that regularly transports goods between Windhelm and Solstheim. The ship recently anchored off Solstheim's western coast, and the crew came ashore for what was intended to be a brief respite. Instead, they were drawn to and entranced by one of the All-Maker Stones - ancient magical pillars sacred to the Skaal. This experience left Benkum disoriented about the passage of time and concerned about their delayed schedule and cargo integrity.{% endblock %}
