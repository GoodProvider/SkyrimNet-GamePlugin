{% block background %}Vasha operates as a notorious criminal throughout Skyrim, having built a reputation significant enough that he claims to have "associates" who would avenge him. His casual reference to being "bagged and dragged" before suggests a history of kidnappings or captures, likely due to his criminal activities. Currently, he's been captured by a Dark Brotherhood assassin alongside two other potential targets, and is being used in a recruitment test for a new Brotherhood initiate.{% endblock %}
