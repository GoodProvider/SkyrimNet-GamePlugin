{% block background %}Born to Sorli and Pactur, the overseers of Rockwallow Mine in Stonehills, Sirgar grew up learning the mining business in this small settlement northwest of Morthal. When the Stormcloaks take control of Hjaalmarch, Ulfric appoints his mother Sorli as Jarl, with his father serving as her steward. Both relocate to Highmoon Hall in Morthal, leaving Sirgar—despite his youth—to manage Stonehills and its mining operations alone, a significant responsibility for someone his age.{% endblock %}

Determined to prove himself capable despite his inexperience.{% endblock %}
