{% block background %}Born to Jafari and Voilla Ratena in Bruma, Cyrodiil, Leleanna was raised in the shadow of the Jerall Mountains with strong Imperial values. Her musical talents manifested early, leading her to pursue formal training at Solitude's prestigious Bards College. She left her hometown despite the civil war, driven by ambition and the relative safety of Imperial-controlled Solitude.

She balances artistic sensitivity with pragmatic career-building, actively networking with Solitude's influential citizens.{% endblock %}
