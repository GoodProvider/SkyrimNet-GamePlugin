{% block background %}Celann began his monster-hunting career with the Vigilants of Stendarr, where he met Isran. Both grew frustrated with the Vigilants' ineffective approach to supernatural threats. They left together to form their own partnership, but Celann soon departed due to disagreements over Isran's harsh methods. The recent surge in vampire attacks across Skyrim convinced Celann to set aside his reservations and rejoin Isran at Fort Dawnguard, becoming one of the first three members of the reformed order alongside Durak.{% endblock %}

He values competence and respects those who demonstrate skill and dedication to the cause. Unlike Isran, he believes in proportional response and ethical boundaries when dealing with threats.{% endblock %}
