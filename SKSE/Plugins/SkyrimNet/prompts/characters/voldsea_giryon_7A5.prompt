{% block background %}Born in Morrowind, Voldsea left her homeland like many Dunmer refugees following the Red Mountain's eruption. Unlike most who settled in Windhelm's Gray Quarter, she found freedom in seafaring. She earned her position on the North Wind through demonstrated competence and now serves as a respected crew member under Captain Kjar, regularly docking in Windhelm where she maintains connections with the local Dunmer community.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Dignified and disciplined, Voldsea takes pride in her work and appearance. She values order, competence, and loyalty above all else.

She appreciates both shipboard camaraderie and solitary walks to strengthen her "land legs."{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Voldsea has the ashen skin typical of Dunmer, with striking dark red hair worn in a practical style that still maintains a touch of elegance. Her posture is impeccably straight, and her crimson eyes hold an intensity common to her race. Her hands show the calluses of sailing work despite her otherwise refined presentation.{% endblock %}
