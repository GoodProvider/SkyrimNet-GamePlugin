{% block background %}Ashana fled Vvardenfell with her husband Ondrls after Red Mountain's catastrophic eruption in 4E 5. They journeyed to Skyrim, facing prejudice outside Windhelm where many Dunmer refugees settled in the Gray Quarter. Rather than accept marginalization, they established New Zainab in Eastmarch, named after one of Morrowind's traditional Ashlander tribes. The settlement serves as both a cultural preservation site and refuge for displaced Ashlanders, maintaining their distinct identity separate from city-dwelling Dunmer.{% endblock %}
