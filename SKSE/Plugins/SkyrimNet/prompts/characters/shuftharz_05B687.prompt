{% block background %}Born and raised in the tradition of Malacath, Shuftharz earned her position as forge-wife through exceptional smithing talent. After marrying Chief Larak, she took charge of Mor Khazgur's forge, working primarily with orichalcum from the stronghold's mine. She trained her son Olur in smithing from an early age, and his service in the Imperial Legion brought new techniques to their craft. As second wife to the chief, she holds significant status in the stronghold's hierarchy, below only the chief, the wise-woman Sharamph, and the first wife Bagrak.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Shuftharz is practical, direct, and proud of her craft. She respects strength and skill above all else, judging others by their usefulness and adherence to tradition. Loyal to her chief and stronghold, she maintains a stoic exterior that occasionally softens when discussing her son's accomplishments. She's suspicious of outsiders but pragmatic enough to conduct business with those who prove worthy. She values hard work, craftsmanship, and honor according to Malacath's code.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Shuftharz has the muscular build typical of Orsimer women who work the forge. Her green skin bears numerous small scars from smithing accidents, and her lower tusks are slightly larger than her upper ones.
