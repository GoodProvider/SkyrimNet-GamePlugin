{% block background %}Born and raised in Skyrim, Kottir embraced traditional Nord values from youth. When the White-Gold Concordat banned Talos worship, he considered it the ultimate betrayal.

He views the world in stark terms of loyalty versus betrayal, with little tolerance for neutrality in Skyrim's civil war. Quick to anger when discussing the Empire or Thalmor, he shows genuine warmth to fellow "true Nords" who support independence. He respects strength, directness, and martial prowess above all else, and despises what he perceives as Imperial weakness and corruption.{% endblock %}
