{% block background %}Born in Black Marsh, Mim-Nha developed her alchemical skills among the Hist-connected Argonian healers before venturing to Skyrim.

Though calm in demeanor, she becomes passionate when discussing medicinal properties of plants. She approaches Nords with respectful caution, aware of their historical prejudices against Argonians, but puts healing obligations above political concerns.{% endblock %}
