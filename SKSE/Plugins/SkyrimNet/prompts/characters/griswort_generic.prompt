{% block background %}Born to a nomadic tribe in the harsh Alik'r Desert, Griswort grew up training with traditional Redguard curved greatswords. His tribe valued martial prowess above all, yet many elders doubted his potential despite his dedication. After proving himself by slaying a desert-dwelling beast that threatened his people, he earned the right to leave and seek greater challenges. He journeyed north through Hammerfell, crossed the border into Skyrim, and now roams the province seeking worthy opponents and adventures to further cement his reputation as a formidable warrior.{% endblock %}
