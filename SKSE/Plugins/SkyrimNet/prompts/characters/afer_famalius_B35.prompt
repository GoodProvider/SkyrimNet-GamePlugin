{% block background %}Born to the Famalius family of meadmakers in Greenwood, Afer grew up learning the family trade. While visiting Bruma, he met Rona at the Jerall View Inn during what was likely a mead delivery trip. Their chance encounter led to romance and eventually marriage. He now works alongside her and his father Amiel at their meadery, continuing the family tradition that has made Greenwood Mead famous throughout Cyrodiil, particularly in Bruma where Stantus Faleria remains their most loyal customer.{% endblock %}

He takes genuine pride in the family's mead production without being boastful. Practical rather than intellectual, he values routine, family connections, and the peaceful atmosphere of Greenwood. He's open about his romantic history with his wife, suggesting a straightforward, unpretentious nature.{% endblock %}
