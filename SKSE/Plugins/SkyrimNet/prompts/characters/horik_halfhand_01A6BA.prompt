{% block background %}Born on a Nord farm, Horik lost his parents young and joined the Imperial Legion at coming-of-age. He served under Brina Merilis during the Great War against the Aldmeri Dominion thirty years ago, where she held the rank of Legate. After decades of service, they retired together to Dawnstar, where they face suspicion from Jarl Skald the Elder due to their Imperial connections. Despite this, Horik and Brina are respected by most townspeople, who often prefer Brina's counsel to Skald's. The Legion is Horik's only true family, and he has remained at Brina's side for his entire adult life.{% endblock %}
