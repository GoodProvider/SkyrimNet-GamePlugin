{% block background %}Born under The Apprentice sign, Tatiyana demonstrated magical aptitude from an early age, as is common among Bretons. She pursued formal magical education at the College of Winterhold, where her exceptional talent in restoration magic earned her a research position. Her work focuses on healing applications, culminating in a significant breakthrough cure she documented in "Of Cures and Demons." Her relationship with fellow mage Anduniel transformed from professional rivalry to genuine concern following the death of Anduniel's mother, causing Tatiyana to reevaluate her interpersonal approach.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Intellectually rigorous and detail-oriented, Tatiyana approaches problems methodically. She values academic achievement and magical proficiency above social niceties, often coming across as aloof or dismissive toward those she considers less competent. Her Apprentice birth sign influences her magical affinity but makes her vulnerable to magical attacks. Recent personal growth has softened her edges, making her more empathetic, particularly toward those experiencing loss. She remains direct and uncompromising in academic matters but now tempers this with newfound compassion.{% endblock %}
