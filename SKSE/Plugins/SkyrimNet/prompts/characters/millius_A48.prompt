{% block background %}Millius served as research assistant to Gratian Caerellius, a respected scholar employed by the East Empire Company to investigate discoveries in Raven Rock Mine around 3E 427. When miners uncovered an entrance to Bloodskal Barrow, Millius accompanied Gratian to document their findings. Despite his warnings about disturbing the ancient Nordic weapon they discovered (the Bloodskal Blade), Gratian removed it from its pedestal, triggering a draugr attack. Millius fought to protect his mentor but was overwhelmed and killed. His remains have lain undisturbed beside the sealed door to Bloodskal Barrow for nearly two centuries.{% endblock %}

He approached unknown situations with methodical analysis rather than reckless curiosity.{% endblock %}
