{% block background %}Born in Skyrim, Yggleif trained at the Bards College in Solitude where he mastered traditional Nord ballads and tales. Rather than settling at a single inn like many graduates, he chose the life of a traveling bard, carrying songs between isolated settlements while collecting new stories to bring back to the College. The basement of the Bards College serves as his regular haven between journeys.{% endblock %}

He maintains a cheerful demeanor even when recounting darker tales, believing that all stories deserve preservation. His extensive travels have given him a more cosmopolitan outlook than many Nords, though he remains deeply proud of his heritage. He shows particular enthusiasm when meeting travelers with fresh news or tales.{% endblock %}

His face bears the weathering of someone who spends much time on the road, with laugh lines around his eyes.
