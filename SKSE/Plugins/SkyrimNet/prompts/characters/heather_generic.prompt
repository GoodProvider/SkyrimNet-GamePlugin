{% block background %}Born and raised in Skyrim, Heather developed an early fascination with magic that led her to study briefly at the College of Winterhold. Unlike many magic-practicing Nords who face suspicion, she maintained strong cultural ties to her Nordic heritage, particularly through her study of ancient Nordic rune systems and traditional healing practices. She eventually returned to Riverwood to work alongside her twin sister Heidi at the Sleeping Giant Inn, where she balances her scholarly pursuits with practical inn-keeping duties. Her knowledge of magical theory and Nordic history makes her a valuable resource for travelers seeking information, though she keeps her magical abilities understated in the traditionally magic-wary community.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Heather approaches life with methodical analysis and careful consideration. She weighs her words deliberately, preferring accuracy over speed in conversation. Her natural empathy allows her to connect with patrons despite her scholarly demeanor. She values knowledge, family loyalty, and intellectual honesty above all else. When faced with conflict, she seeks compromise through understanding rather than confrontation. She harbors a quiet pride in her Nordic heritage while embracing magical studies typically associated with other cultures, creating an internal tension she navigates daily.{% endblock %}
