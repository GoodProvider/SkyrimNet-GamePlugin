{% block background %}Mucky Ovacca was once a member of Thorina's Cutters, a feared bandit group operating in the Jerall Mountains along the Cyrodiil-Skyrim border. After witnessing their brutality firsthand and growing disillusioned with bandit life, she defected, taking knowledge of their operations and hideouts with her. Now Thorina has dispatched Retching Cornelius, a ruthless enforcer, to silence her permanently. Mucky has established a makeshift camp north of Bruma's stables, surviving on minimal supplies while planning her escape to the Imperial City.{% endblock %}

Sleep-deprived and hungry, she's irritable and jumpy, but becomes animated when discussing escape plans.{% endblock %}
