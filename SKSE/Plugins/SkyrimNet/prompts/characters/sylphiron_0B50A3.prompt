{% block background %}Born into a Bosmeri tribe that practiced ritual cannibalism, Sylphiron participated in her first cannibalistic feast at age seven. She eventually made her way to Skyrim and settled in Markarth, where she found kinship with Lisbet, owner of Arnleif and Sons Trading Company. Together they joined Eola's cult of Namira, participating in secret feasts at Reachcliff Cave. Sylphiron's primary role in the cult is preparing human flesh for consumption, a skill she applies with meticulous care. She maintains absolute secrecy about these practices when in public, especially around Lisbet's other employees.{% endblock %}
