{% block background %}Born in Windhelm during the Civil War, Urchin lost his parents and now survives in the city's shadows. He sleeps in abandoned corners of the Stone Quarter, avoiding the guards and enduring Windhelm's brutal cold. The Nord-dominated city offers little charity, forcing him to develop street smarts beyond his years. He witnesses the racial tensions between Nords and Dunmer daily, and has learned which merchants might offer scraps and which nobles to avoid.{% endblock %}
