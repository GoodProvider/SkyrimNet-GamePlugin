{% block background %}Malkoran is a Breton necromancer who has seized control of Kilkreath Temple, a site sacred to the Daedric Prince Meridia. He has acquired Meridia's artifact, Dawnbreaker, and perverted its power to create an army of corrupted shades from the bodies of those who died in Skyrim's civil war. This desecration is a deliberate affront to Meridia, who despises the undead and those who manipulate the dead. His presence in the temple has drawn Meridia's wrath, but his magical prowess has allowed him to maintain control of the ruins despite this divine opposition.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Malkoran is arrogant, ruthless, and calculating. He values power above all else and feels contempt for those weaker than himself.

He takes particular satisfaction in perverting Meridia's artifact to serve necromantic purposes, demonstrating his disdain for Daedric authority.{% endblock %}
