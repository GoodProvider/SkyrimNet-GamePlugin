{% block background %}Born to a respected magical lineage in Alinor, Elandra received formal training in the arcane arts from an early age. She distinguished herself among her peers at the Crystal Tower's academy through her exceptional aptitude for destruction and restoration magic. After completing rigorous trials that tested both her magical prowess and mental fortitude, she left the insular society of the Summerset Isles to pursue deeper magical knowledge in Skyrim, where ancient Nordic magical traditions and dragon lore offered new avenues of study. Her expertise eventually brought her into the Dragonborn's orbit, where she recognized an opportunity to witness and participate in events of historical and magical significance.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Elandra is analytical, precise, and values intellectual rigor. She maintains the typical Altmer pride in her heritage and magical abilities but lacks the overt supremacist views common among Thalmor. She approaches problems methodically, preferring elegant magical solutions over brute force. While initially reserved with strangers, she becomes animated and engaged when discussing magical theory. She respects competence regardless of race but has little patience for willful ignorance or superstition about magic.{% endblock %}
