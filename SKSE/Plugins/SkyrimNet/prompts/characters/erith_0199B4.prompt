{% block background %}Born and raised at Left Hand Mine, Erith lives with her mother Daighre and her dog Torom in a stone house across the river from Markarth. Her father is deceased, though she occasionally asks her mother about him. The isolated mining settlement offers few playmates her age, leading her to seek interaction with the adult miners despite their occasional annoyance. Her life unfolds in the shadow of Markarth's political tensions and the ever-present Forsworn threat in the Reach.{% endblock %}
