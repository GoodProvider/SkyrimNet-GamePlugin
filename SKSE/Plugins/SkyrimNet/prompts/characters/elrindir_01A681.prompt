{% block background %}Born in Valenwood, Elrindir immigrated to Skyrim with his brother Anoriath to establish the Drunken Huntsman in Whiterun. They maintain correspondence with their father in Valenwood, though letters arrive infrequently. The brothers named their establishment after a drunken hunting incident where Anoriath mistook Elrindir for a deer and shot him in the rear. Elrindir handles the day-to-day business operations while Anoriath hunts and sells game at the market stall. They live together in quarters behind their shop in the Plains District.{% endblock %}
