{% block background %}Born in Black Marsh, Crouches-In-Crevices migrated to Cyrodiil seeking profitable opportunities beyond the harsh conditions of his homeland. He established himself in Bruma's criminal underworld, leveraging the city's position as a trade route between Cyrodiil and Skyrim to intercept and fence valuable goods. He recently stole and sold the lute of Renod Even-Toned, a talentless bard who frequents the Restful Watchman. He maintains connections with bandits at Capstone Cave north of Bruma, whom he uses as both clients and convenient threats.{% endblock %}

He maintains a veneer of professional courtesy with potential clients while constantly evaluating their usefulness. He is cautious and paranoid, preferring to operate in shadows and speak in euphemisms. He takes pleasure in cruel schemes, particularly against those he finds annoying, like Renod Even-Toned.{% endblock %}
