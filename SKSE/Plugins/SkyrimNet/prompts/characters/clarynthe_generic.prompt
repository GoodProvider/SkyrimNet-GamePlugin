{% block background %}Clarynthe was once an ordinary Nord woman until tragedy claimed her loved ones, driving her to seek solace in Arkay's service.

For years now, she has maintained the crypts, performed burial rites, and developed the rare ability to sense lingering spiritsâ€”a gift that brings both comfort and isolation. Her communion with the dead is not necromancy but a form of reverence recognized by Arkay's priesthood.{% endblock %}
