{% block background %}Telrav operates a well-established ambush scheme in The Rift near the border with Eastmarch. He positions himself by a wrecked cart near a stone bridge, pretending to be a merchant whose goods were stolen by bandits.

His operation has likely been successful for some time, as he has perfected his act and established a permanent base in the ruins.{% endblock %}

{% block speech_style %}Telrav speaks in two distinct styles: As a "merchant," his voice trembles with practiced fear, using short, desperate sentences with pleading tones. His Imperial accent becomes more pronounced when frightened. When revealing his true nature, his voice drops to a confident, smug tone with mocking inflection. He speaks more slowly and deliberately when threatening, savoring his victims' realization of his deception.{% endblock %}
