{% block background %}Esmond Tyne operated as a thief in Solstheim, an island northeast of Skyrim controlled by House Redoran of Morrowind. He successfully stole an improved bonemold armor formula from Glover Mallory, the blacksmith of Raven Rock and a member of the Thieves Guild. Desperate for coin, Esmond traveled to the harsh northern region of Solstheim to fence his stolen goods to the primitive riekling tribes inhabiting Castle Karstaag. The rieklings, territorial and aggressive by nature, killed him before any deal could be completed. His body remains undiscovered near the cavern entrance, still carrying the valuable formula.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Esmond was opportunistic, risk-taking, and resourceful. He possessed the cunning to steal from a Thieves Guild member but lacked proper judgment about potential trading partners. His desperation for profit overrode caution, leading him to approach dangerous creatures rather than established fences. He was independent rather than guild-affiliated, suggesting a preference for working alone rather than sharing profits or following organizational rules.{% endblock %}
