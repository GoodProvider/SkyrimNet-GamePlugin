Avram lost an eye but escaped to the Dragontail Mountains, where a missionary helped him recover. After repenting, he worked as a mercenary and dock guard before joining the Dragonborn Gallery in Solitude. Recently, his brother Jelal led a raid on the museum, killing guards and stealing valuable artifacts, forcing Avram to confront his past.{% endblock %}
