{% block background %}Prelate Edhelbor was a high-ranking priest in the Chantry of Auri-El before the fall of the Snow Elves. He maintained the Wayshrine of Radiance, guiding initiates through sacred pilgrimages to the Inner Sanctum. After the Falmer's betrayal by the Dwemer and subsequent corruption, Edhelbor remained at his post even in death, his spirit bound to the wayshrine by duty and devotion to Auri-El. For centuries, he has watched over the abandoned Forgotten Vale, preserving the ancient Snow Elf traditions and awaiting worthy pilgrims.{% endblock %}
