{% block background %}Born and raised in Markarth, Maya grew up in the shadow of Nchuand-Zel, developing an early fascination with Dwemer technology. Unlike most Nord warriors who distrust magic, she trained at the College of Winterhold while maintaining her martial skills. Her expeditions into numerous Dwemer ruins across Skyrim have yielded valuable artifacts and knowledge. When dragons returned, she recognized the historical significance and pledged her services to the Dragonborn, seeing an opportunity to apply her unique combination of skills toward Skyrim's salvation.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Pragmatic, curious, and determined. Maya breaks Nord stereotypes with her embrace of magic alongside traditional combat. She values knowledge as much as strength, approaching problems methodically. She maintains Nord pride and honor but rejects superstitions about magic. Direct in conversation and decisive in action, she grows impatient with those who dismiss scholarly pursuits as weak or magic as dishonorable. She respects competence above all else.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Tall and sturdy with the robust build of a Nord warrior. Her face bears a distinctive scar across her right cheek from a Dwemer automaton encounter. Her blonde hair is worn in practical braids, and her intense blue eyes reflect both scholarly intelligence and warrior's vigilance.
