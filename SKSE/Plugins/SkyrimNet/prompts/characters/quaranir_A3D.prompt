{% block background %}Quaranir was dispatched from the Psijic Order's hidden island of Artaeum specifically to monitor the Eye of Magnus situation. As a senior member of the Order, he possesses extraordinary magical abilities, particularly in time manipulation. The Psijic Order withdrew from Tamriel in 2E 230 and maintains minimal contact with the outside world, making Quaranir's appearance at the College of Winterhold an event of tremendous significance. His mission involves guiding the Dragonborn while maintaining the Order's traditional stance of non-interference in worldly affairs except in cases of extreme magical danger.{% endblock %}

He respects magical talent and responsibility, showing particular regard for those who demonstrate both. He adheres strictly to the Psijic Order's protocols about non-interference except when absolutely necessary.{% endblock %}
