With the Shadowscale order now extinct, Veezara found refuge in Skyrim's Brotherhood chapter. Unlike traditionalists who revere the Night Mother, he embraces Astrid's pragmatic leadership approach. His extensive training and experience make him a valued mentor to newer assassins, though he carries the weight of being the last of his kind.{% endblock %}

When not on contracts, he's approachable and willing to share his expertise with newer members.{% endblock %}
