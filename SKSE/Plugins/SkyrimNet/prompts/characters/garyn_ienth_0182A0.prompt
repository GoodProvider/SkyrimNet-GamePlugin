{% block background %}Garyn and his wife Milore fled Morrowind after the Red Mountain's catastrophic eruption in 4E 5. They initially settled in Morthal, Skyrim, but found mainland life dangerous and unwelcoming to Dunmer refugees. Upon learning of the Raven Rock colony on Solstheim, they relocated there permanently. Under House Redoran's governance, they established the settlement's main agricultural operation, growing ash yams and other crops using traditional Dunmer farming techniques. Their farm's critical importance to Raven Rock's survival has earned them both respect and protection, with a Redoran Guard permanently stationed on their property.{% endblock %}
