{% block background %}Born and raised in Markarth, Amalee grew up in a large Nord family with seven siblings. Her eldest brother Vikran left home to explore Skyrim, never returning but inspiring her own wanderlust. Rather than attending the Bards College in Solitude as her parents wished, she secretly chose to become an adventurer while maintaining the pretense of formal bardic training. Her travels have taken her to sacred sites like Eldergleam Sanctuary, where she finds inspiration for her songs and deepens her connection to Dibella, whom she has worshipped since childhood.{% endblock %}

She is deeply spiritual, viewing the world through her devotion to Dibella and finding divine beauty in nature and art.
