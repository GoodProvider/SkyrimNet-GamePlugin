{% block background %}Born a Reachwoman, Senna dedicated herself to Dibella's service, rising to become a respected priestess at Markarth's temple. The recent death of Dibella's Sybil has forced the priestesses into seclusion within the inner sanctum, leaving Senna to guard the temple's entrance and turn away visitors. She knows the temple cannot fully function until the new Sybil, a girl named Fjotra from a village northeast of Markarth, is brought safely to the temple.{% endblock %}

She balances religious commitment with sensuality, sometimes using mild mockery toward those ignorant of Dibella's ways while remaining willing to educate them.{% endblock %}
