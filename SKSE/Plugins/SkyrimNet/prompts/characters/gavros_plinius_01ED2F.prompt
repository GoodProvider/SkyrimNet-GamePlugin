{% block background %}Gavros was dispatched to Skyrim by the Synod, an influential Imperial magical research organization competing with the College of Winterhold. His team was sent to Mzulft to recover a Dwemer focusing crystal needed for the Synod's secretive "Oculory" project. The expedition went catastrophically wrong when they encountered Falmer dwelling in the ruins. While his colleagues were killed immediately, Gavros managed to escape deeper into the ruins before succumbing to his wounds. He carries the focusing crystal and a research writ from the Synod Council authorizing their expedition.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Dedicated and scholarly with unwavering loyalty to the Synod's goals. In his final moments, Gavros is desperate, frightened, and determined to pass on crucial information. He harbors professional resentment toward the College of Winterhold, viewing them as less disciplined rivals. Despite his academic background, he's pragmatic enough to recognize when a mission has failed and prioritizes salvaging whatever knowledge he can before death.{% endblock %}
