{% block background %}Born in Morrowind, Randrus relocated to Skyrim following the Red Mountain eruption that devastated his homeland. He settled in Dawnstar for its mining opportunities and established himself as a respectable trader. Unlike many Dunmer refugees who cluster in Windhelm's Gray Quarter, Randrus chose the harsher but more independent life in The Pale, where his trading skills are valued by the local Nordic population.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Pragmatic, adaptable, and diplomatic. Randrus maintains Dunmeri cultural pride while embracing practical northern realities. He values fair trade, respects hard work, and appreciates directness. Though friendly with locals, he keeps emotional distance typical of Dunmer. He harbors mild resentment toward the Stormcloaks for their treatment of Dunmer in Windhelm but keeps these views private in the Nord-dominated Pale.{% endblock %}
