Rather than settling into village life, Chelsea chose to wander Skyrim's diverse landscapes, from the pine forests of Falkreath to the tundra of Whiterun Hold. Her nomadic lifestyle has given her intimate knowledge of Skyrim's wildlife, terrain, and the dangers that lurk in its remote areas.{% endblock %}
