{% block background %}Born in Black Marsh, Scouts-Many-Marshes migrated to Skyrim seeking better opportunities despite the harsh climate. He secured work at Windhelm's docks, where Argonians are relegated to the worst jobs and poorest living conditions. Unlike many Argonians who grow bitter from Nord prejudice, he maintains hope for a more equitable future. He lives in the squalid Argonian Assemblage outside city walls with fellow Argonian workers, spending his days loading cargo and chopping firewood for meager pay from the Shatter-Shield clan.{% endblock %}

His unusual tolerance toward Nords and Dunmer stems from a deep-seated belief in cooperation. He demonstrates remarkable resilience in the face of discrimination, maintaining dignity despite poor treatment. Though frustrated by unfair wages, he approaches the situation with measured determination rather than anger.{% endblock %}
