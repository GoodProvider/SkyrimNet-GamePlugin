{% block background %}Born to a Dunmer tribe in Morrowind, Zorya's life changed dramatically when rogue fire mages slaughtered her people ten years ago. She escaped the massacre and dedicated herself to mastering conjuration magic, specifically to summon powerful entities from Oblivion as allies in her quest for vengeance. Over the past decade, she has tracked and eliminated many of the responsible mages across Skyrim, earning a reputation among magic practitioners as "the conjurer of the ash." Her pursuit of vengeance has taken her through many of Skyrim's holds, where she's developed combat versatility to survive the harsh environment and dangerous encounters.{% endblock %}

She maintains emotional distance from others through a cold, calculating demeanor that softens only after prolonged positive interaction. Despite her hardened exterior, she retains a fragile innocence regarding personal relationships and can show surprising loyalty and kindness to those few who earn her respect. She is pragmatic in combat, methodically assessing threats before deciding whether to engage directly or through her summoned allies. Her bitterness and grief remain close to the surface, occasionally manifesting as sudden anger or quiet withdrawal.{% endblock %}
