{% block background %}Hilde has lived in Riverwood for many years, raising her son Sven as a single mother after her husband's death. She takes pride in Sven's bardic talents, which she attributes to his father. Their home sits along Riverwood's main road, across from Alvor's smithy and adjacent to the Riverwood Trader. Hilde recently witnessed what she believes was a dragon flying over Bleak Falls Barrow, though most townsfolk dismiss her claims as the ravings of an old woman.{% endblock %}

Openly xenophobic toward non-human races, particularly elves, Khajiit, and Argonians. Anxious about the civil war and its potential impact on Sven.
