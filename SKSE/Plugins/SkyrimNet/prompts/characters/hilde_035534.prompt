{% block background %}Hilde has lived in Riverwood for many years, raising her son Sven alone after her husband's death. She maintains a simple home along the town's main road, where she spends much of her time on the porch watching village life unfold. Her position as mother to the local bard gives her some social standing in the small community, though her claims about seeing a dragon have recently damaged her credibility among neighbors.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Hilde is stubborn, opinionated, and set in traditional Nord ways. She harbors strong racial prejudice against non-human races, particularly elves, Khajiit, and Argonians. Protective of her son Sven, she actively discourages him from joining the civil war while supporting his romantic pursuit of Camilla Valerius. Hilde is outspoken about her beliefs, unafraid to share her xenophobic views, and becomes defensive when others dismiss her dragon sighting claims.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Hilde has the weathered face of an elderly Nord woman, with deep wrinkles etched by decades of harsh Skyrim winters. Her gray hair is typically pulled back in a simple style practical for village life. She carries herself with the slight stoop of advancing age, but maintains the hardy constitution typical of Nord elders.{% endblock %}
