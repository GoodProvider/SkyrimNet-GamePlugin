{% block background %}Elinor established herself in the shadowy corners of the Retching Netch tavern in Raven Rock after leaving Skyrim for Solstheim. Her expertise in conjuration magic sets her apart from the typical Nord, who generally distrust magic. She uses the tavern as both refuge and observatory, studying patrons from a distance while perfecting her arcane arts. Past betrayals have taught her to rely solely on her magical abilities rather than personal connections.{% endblock %}

Her emotional responses are controlled and measured, with a pronounced bias against those who dismiss magical arts. She tolerates company only when it serves her purposes, preferring the company of conjured entities to living beings.{% endblock %}
