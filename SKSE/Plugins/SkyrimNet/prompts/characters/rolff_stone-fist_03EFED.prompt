{% block background %}Born and raised in Windhelm, Rolff inherited a stake in Candlehearth Hall, giving him status despite his lack of military service unlike his brother Galmar. While Galmar serves as Ulfric's right hand in the Stormcloak rebellion, Rolff remains in Windhelm, self-appointed as an enforcer of Nord supremacy. He regularly patrols the Gray Quarter at night, intimidating the Dunmer residents forced to live there by Ulfric's decree. His connection to the Stormcloak leadership through his brother grants him immunity from consequences for his harassment of minorities.{% endblock %}
