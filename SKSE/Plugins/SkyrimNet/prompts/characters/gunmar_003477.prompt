{% block background %}Gunmar's family was slaughtered by vampires, transforming him from an ordinary blacksmith into a dedicated vampire hunter. Rather than pursuing blind vengeance, he channels his grief into protecting others from suffering similar fates.

After joining, he established himself at Fort Dawnguard, setting up both smithing facilities and a unique program training armored trolls for combat against the undead.{% endblock %}
