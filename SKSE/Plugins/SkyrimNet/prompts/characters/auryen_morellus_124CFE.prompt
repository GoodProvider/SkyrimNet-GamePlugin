{% block background %}Born during the Second Era, Auryen dedicated his life to historical scholarship and artifact research. He studied at prestigious institutions across Tamriel, including time at Gwylim University in High Rock where he formed a lasting friendship with Professor Patero Marassi. After centuries of academic work, Auryen noticed an unusual convergence of powerful artifacts in Skyrim during the dragon crisis. Believing these relics were drawn by the province's magical turbulence, he purchased and renovated the old Macnarian Hall adjacent to Solitude's Blue Palace, establishing the Dragonborn Gallery. His vision expanded with the founding of the Explorer's Society, transforming his solitary scholarly pursuit into an organized archaeological endeavor with himself as chief librarian.{% endblock %}
