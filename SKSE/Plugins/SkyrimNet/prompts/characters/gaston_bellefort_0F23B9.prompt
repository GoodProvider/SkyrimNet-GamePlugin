{% block background %}Gaston Bellefort established himself as a scholar of Tamriel's most secretive organizations, particularly the Dark Brotherhood. His obsession with uncovering the truth about the Night Mother led him to publish "The Night Mother's Truth," a controversial text questioning Brotherhood mythology. His research eventually drove him to attempt direct infiltration of the Falkreath Sanctuary. After multiple successful reconnaissance missions, his final infiltration failed when he was discovered, captured, and fed to Lis, the Brotherhood's pet Frostbite Spider, as punishment for his trespassing.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Obsessive, meticulous, and fearlessly curious, Gaston pursued forbidden knowledge regardless of personal risk. He maintained scholarly detachment while investigating dark subjects, believing truth should be documented regardless of consequences. He was stubborn to the point of recklessness, dismissive of warnings, and possessed unwavering confidence in his intellectual abilities. His academic arrogance ultimately blinded him to the very real dangers of his research.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Gaston is now merely a skeleton in Lis's nest, his remains picked clean. In life, he was a typical Breton of average height with a scholar's physique, pale complexion from long hours indoors, and intense, observant eyes that missed no detail.{% endblock %}
