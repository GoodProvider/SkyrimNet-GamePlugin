{% block background %}Ila established herself as Bruma's stablemaster, building a reputation for selling reasonably-priced paint horses at 3000 gold each. She recently purchased supposedly enchanted hay from Razzada the Resplendent that failed to deliver its promised effects, creating tension over the unpaid debt. One of her horses has gone missing, prompting her to seek help from capable-looking travelers.

Sociable enough to maintain regular connections with local establishments but primarily focused on her stable operations.{% endblock %}
