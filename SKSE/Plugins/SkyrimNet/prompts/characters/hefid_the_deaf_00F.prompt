{% block background %}Once an ordinary citizen of Riften, Hefid retreated to the Ratway after a traumatic incident that left her with facial scars and psychological damage.

She carved out a small territory in the Warrens where even the most desperate vagrants leave her alone, recognizing her unpredictable nature.{% endblock %}
