{% block background %}Adisla has spent years working the wheat fields at Hlaalu Farm, located east of Windhelm along the River Yogrim. She lives on the property owned by Belyn Hlaalu, a Dark Elf from the once-great House Hlaalu.

She displays tolerance toward minor inconveniences like neighboring farm animals straying onto Hlaalu property, preferring to avoid unnecessary conflict.{% endblock %}
