{% block background %}Bjorn is a native Solitude resident who secured a position as a guard at the Dragonborn Gallery after its establishment by the Altmer historian Auryen Morellus. The museum houses an expanding collection of powerful relics and artifacts from across Tamriel that have mysteriously appeared in Skyrim. Bjorn works alongside several other guards, patrolling the halls to prevent theft of the increasingly valuable and potentially dangerous items on display. His position carries significant responsibility, as many artifacts possess supernatural powers that would be catastrophic in the wrong hands.{% endblock %}

He maintains professional distance with visitors while showing genuine interest in the museum's collection.

He harbors typical Nord suspicion toward the Thalmor and Imperial oversight but keeps these opinions subdued while on duty.{% endblock %}
