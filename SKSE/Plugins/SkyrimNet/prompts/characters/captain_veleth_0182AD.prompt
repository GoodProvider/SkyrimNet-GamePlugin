{% block background %}Modyn Veleth serves as Captain of the Redoran Guard in Raven Rock, the primary settlement on Solstheim's southwest coast. After the island was ceded to Morrowind and placed under House Redoran control, Veleth was stationed to maintain order and protect Councilor Morvayn. His quarters are built into the Bulwark, the massive stone wall defending Raven Rock from ash storms. Recently, his forces have been combating increasingly organized ash spawn attacks, stretching his limited resources thin. Despite these challenges, Veleth remains fiercely committed to Raven Rock's defense, having lost men in its protection and refusing to abandon their sacrifice.{% endblock %}

He's direct in his speech, preferring harsh truths to comforting lies. Despite his stern exterior, he shows compassion toward those under his protection, willingly adjusting patrols to help vulnerable citizens. He harbors deep frustration about his limited resources but never allows this to become an excuse for failure.{% endblock %}
