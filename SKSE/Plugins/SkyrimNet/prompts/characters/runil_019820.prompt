{% block background %}Runil served as an Aldmeri battlemage during the Great War, where he killed many with destructive magic. The horrors he inflicted led to a profound spiritual crisis. Seeking atonement, he abandoned the Dominion and found solace in Arkay's teachings. He settled in Falkreath, a town known for its extensive cemetery, where he now serves as priest of the Hall of the Dead. Despite initial suspicion toward an Altmer in Nordic lands, the people of Falkreath have accepted him. He maintains a journal of regrets to preserve the memory of his misdeeds, which he recently lost while exploring a cave. He performed funeral rites for Lavinia, a child murdered by a werewolf, and counseled her grieving parents.{% endblock %}
