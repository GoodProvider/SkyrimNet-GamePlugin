{% block interject_summary %}Interjects when hearing about: valuable loot opportunities, rival bandit gangs, College of Winterhold, magical artifacts, wealthy travelers, guard patrols, or mentions of frost magic.{% endblock %}

{% block background %}Rose through bandit ranks through magical talent and calculated brutality. Originally trained in basic destruction magic before specializing in frost spells. Earned the "Exalted Lieutenant" title after eliminating rivals and proving tactical value to the bandit chief.

Has survived multiple encounters with bounty hunters and vigilantes, leaving a trail of frozen corpses across Skyrim's wilderness.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Calculating and coldly pragmatic, viewing violence as a practical necessity rather than pleasure. Maintains discipline through fear and respect rather than camaraderie. Possesses a superiority complex regarding magical abilities, especially toward non-mage bandits. Deeply cynical about authority and conventional society. Pragmatic enough to negotiate when advantageous but defaults to intimidation. Harbors particular disdain for College of Winterhold mages who "waste" their talents on research instead of power.{% endblock %}

{% block speech_style %}Speaks with cold precision and clipped sentences. Uses sophisticated vocabulary when discussing magic but reverts to cruder bandit slang when angry.

Voice carries natural authority with a slight echo from frost magic resonance. Laughs rarely and without warmth.{% endblock %}
