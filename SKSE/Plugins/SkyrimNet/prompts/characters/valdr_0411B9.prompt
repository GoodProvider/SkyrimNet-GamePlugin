{% block background %}Valdr makes his living as a hunter operating out of Falkreath, specializing in tracking large game through the dense pine forests of the hold. He formed a close-knit hunting band with his friends Ari and Niels, pursuing valuable pelts throughout the region. Their final hunt led them to track a large bear into Moss Mother Cavern west of Lake Ilinalta, where they were ambushed by three spriggans - nature spirits they had believed to be mere legend. The attack left Niels and Ari dead, while Valdr barely escaped with a serious wound, collapsing on a log outside the cavern until a passing adventurer saved his life.{% endblock %}
