{% block background %}Myvrana Giladren left Valenwood to pursue magical studies unavailable in her homeland. At the College of Winterhold, she quickly distinguished herself by challenging the traditional approach of specializing in a single school of magic. Her philosophical stance has made her both allies and rivals among faculty members. She conducts regular experiments combining techniques from multiple magical disciplines, documenting her findings meticulously in journals that she keeps in her quarters.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Confident and intellectually curious, Myvrana approaches magical theory with enthusiasm and openness. She values practical application over rigid tradition, believing magical schools are tools rather than separate disciplines. She grows impatient with dogmatic thinking but remains respectful in academic discourse. Her Bosmer heritage gives her a natural affinity for understanding the interconnectedness of different forces, which she applies to her magical philosophy.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Myvrana has the typical Bosmer features: slight build, pointed ears, and almond-shaped eyes with a distinctive amber hue. Her expressions are animated when discussing magical theory, and she often gestures with her hands to illustrate magical concepts. Faint magical residue occasionally shimmers around her fingertips from constant spellcasting practice.{% endblock %}
