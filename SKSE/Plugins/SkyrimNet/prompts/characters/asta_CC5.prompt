{% block background %}Asta has dedicated her life to Kynareth, goddess of the heavens, wind, and elements. She made a pilgrimage to Eldergleam Sanctuary and chose to remain there, finding purpose in tending to the sacred space and guiding visitors. She has extensive knowledge of the Eldergleam treeâ€”believed to be the oldest living thing in Skyrim and a direct descendant of the Gildergreen in Whiterun. Asta has heard rumors of Nettlebane, the ancient Hagraven blade that can cut through the Eldergleam's protective roots, but considers its use sacrilegious.{% endblock %}

She becomes protective and stern when the sanctuary or Eldergleam is threatened, transforming from gentle guide to fierce defender.
