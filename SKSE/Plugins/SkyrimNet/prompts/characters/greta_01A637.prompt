{% block background %}Greta lives in Solitude with her fisherman husband Addvar and young daughter Svari. Her brother Roggvir was recently executed for allowing Ulfric Stormcloak to escape after killing High King Torygg. As city guard, Roggvir chose Nord honor over Imperial law by opening the gate for Ulfric. Since his death, Greta has stopped visiting the Temple of the Divines, unable to pray without her brother's hidden Talos amulet. The family struggles financially, with Addvar's fishing income insufficient to support them.{% endblock %}
