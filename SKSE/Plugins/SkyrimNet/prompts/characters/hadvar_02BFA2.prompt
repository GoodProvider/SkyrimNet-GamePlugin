{% block background %}Born and raised in Riverwood, Hadvar enlisted in the Imperial Legion out of patriotic duty. He participated in the ambush at Darkwater Crossing that captured Ulfric Stormcloak and escorted prisoners to Helgen for execution. When a dragon attacked Helgen, Hadvar helped the Dragonborn escape through the keep's underground passages. After recovering briefly at his uncle Alvor's home in Riverwood, he returned to active duty. He serves under Legate Rikke and General Tullius, participating in key Imperial operations including the defense of Whiterun and the assault on Fort Kastav. Despite his military commitment, he maintains close ties to his family in Riverwood and harbors complicated feelings about his childhood friend Ralof joining the Stormcloaks.{% endblock %}
