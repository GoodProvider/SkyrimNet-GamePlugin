{% block background %}Minette was born and raised in Solitude as the daughter of Corpulus Vinius, proprietor of the Winking Skeever. She has spent her entire life in the busy tavern near Solitude's main gate, absorbing knowledge about its operations while observing the comings and goings of patrons from across Skyrim. Her family has deep roots in the hospitality business, with her aunt Faida running the Four Shields Tavern in Dragon Bridge. Minette has grown up in the shadow of her older brother Sorex, who their father grooms to eventually take over the business despite his reluctance and Minette's superior interest and aptitude.{% endblock %}
