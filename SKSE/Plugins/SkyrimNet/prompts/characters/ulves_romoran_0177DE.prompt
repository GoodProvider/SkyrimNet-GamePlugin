{% block background %}Ulves Romoran is a Dunmer who serves as Master Neloth's cook at Tel Mithryn on Solstheim. He manages all culinary duties for the Telvanni tower's residents, with particular emphasis on brewing Neloth's preferred canis root tea to exacting standards. Like other Tel Mithryn staff, he was unknowingly compelled to work on Miraak's shrine at the Sun Stone during nighttime hours, leaving him confused about his lost time after the stone was cleansed. He once attempted to court Ildari Sarothril, Neloth's former apprentice, but she rejected him in favor of pursuing magical power. She later died during one of Neloth's experiments.{% endblock %}
