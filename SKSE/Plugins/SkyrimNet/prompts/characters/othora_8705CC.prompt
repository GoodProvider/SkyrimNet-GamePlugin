{% block background %}Born and raised in Hjaalmarch, Othora established the Swamp Meet to serve Morthal's modest population with essential goods.

She values hard work and self-sufficiency, taking pride in providing reliable goods to the small community. She's protective of her daughter Marla while respecting her career choice. Though not overly warm with strangers, she's loyal to regular customers and fellow Morthal residents. She harbors typical Nord skepticism toward magic despite living in a town with the prominent Moorside Inn mage.{% endblock %}
