{% block background %}Tulvur has worked Hollyfrost Farm outside Windhelm for several years under Torsten Cruel-Sea, a wealthy Nord merchant whose family traditionally worked the seas rather than the land.

Tulvur lives alone in the farmhouse with his two dogs, Tiber and Ysgramor, whom he deeply cherishes.

He's resilient against Skyrim's harsh conditions and values his independence, though he sometimes feels isolated. He maintains a dry humor about his circumstances and shows genuine affection for his animals.{% endblock %}
