{% block interject_summary %}Sigrid interjects when someone mentions her daughter's unladylike behavior, when discussing the civil war (especially pro-Stormcloak sentiments), when men make advances toward her, or when Embry's drunkenness is brought up.{% endblock %}

{% block background %}Born and raised in Skyrim, Sigrid settled in Riverwood after marrying Alvor, the town blacksmith. They built a life together on the banks of the White River, raising their daughter Dorthe in this small lumber community. Despite the tensions of the civil war, Sigrid maintains a cordial relationship with Stormcloak-supporting neighbors, particularly Gerdur and Hod who run the town's vital sawmill.{% endblock %}

She's hospitable to family but wary of strangers, and becomes irritated when her husband spends too much time drinking at the local inn.{% endblock %}
