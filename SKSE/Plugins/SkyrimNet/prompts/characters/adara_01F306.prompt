{% block background %}Born to Redguard silversmiths Endon and Kerah in Markarth, Adara lives in the stone city known for its Dwemer architecture and silver mines. Her older brother Cade left home to fight for the Stormcloaks in the Civil War, creating a complex family dynamic as Adara herself admires the Imperial Legion. With no other children her age in her social circle, she has developed an early proficiency in silversmithing, working alongside her parents at their market stall in Markarth's central plaza.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Enthusiastic and restless, Adara struggles to contain her childish energy in the formal stone city. She takes pride in her crafting abilities and craves validation for her work. Torn between family loyalty and her own developing political views, she respects her brother's choice while forming her own contrary opinion about the Civil War. Industrious beyond her years, she channels her isolation into productive skill-building rather than play.{% endblock %}
