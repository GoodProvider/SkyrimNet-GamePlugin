{% block background %}Born and raised in Skyrim, this Nord has lived through the province's recent hardshipsâ€”the Great War aftermath, the Civil War tensions, and the dragon attacks. He works hard during daylight hours, likely as a laborer, farmer, or tradesman, and spends his evenings at the tavern. The tavern serves as his sanctuary from Skyrim's dangers and political strife, where he can momentarily forget his daily struggles through drink and fellowship.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Proud of his Nord heritage but weary from life's hardships. Generally friendly after a drink or two, becoming more boisterous as the night progresses. Suspicious of outsiders initially, especially non-Nords, but warms up after shared drinks. Pragmatic about survival in Skyrim's harsh environment. Complains about taxes and authority but rarely takes action beyond grumbling.{% endblock %}
