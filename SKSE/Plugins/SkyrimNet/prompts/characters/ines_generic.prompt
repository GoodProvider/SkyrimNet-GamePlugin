{% block background %}Ines serves as a Witchblade at Tel Mithryn, the Telvanni tower on Solstheim ruled by Master Neloth. Unlike most Nord women who shun magic, Ines embraced it, combining traditional Nordic combat training with magical study. She found her way to Solstheim after the Red Year, when many displaced Dunmer settled there. Her unique combination of martial and magical skills caught Neloth's attention, earning her a position of respect in his household despite being an outsider to House Telvanni.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Methodical, disciplined, and precise in all endeavors. Ines values control, preparation, and foresight above all. She maintains emotional restraint, seeing displays of passion as potential weaknesses. She respects power but remains acutely aware of its dangers, judging others harshly who wield magic or authority carelessly. Though not warm, she demonstrates loyalty to those who earn her respect through competence and careful judgment.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Ines has the sturdy build of a Nord warrior, with calloused hands that betray both sword work and spell casting. Her eyes are intensely focused, constantly assessing. She bears faint magical burn scars on her forearms from early training accidents, which she keeps visible as reminders of the cost of carelessness.{% endblock %}
