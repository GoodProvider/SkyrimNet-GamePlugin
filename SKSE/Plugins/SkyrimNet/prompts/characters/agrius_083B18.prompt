{% block background %}Agrius served as a thief in the notorious Knifepoint Gang operating throughout Falkreath Hold. After being expelled from the gang for reasons he took to his grave, he fled with fellow bandits Raen and Vidgrod to Halldir's Cairn. Unaware of the ancient Nordic burial site's dark history, the trio unwittingly awakened Halldir, a powerful necromancer whose spirit had lingered for centuries. Halldir gradually dominated their minds, eventually compelling all three to sacrifice themselves at the cairn's center, feeding his resurrection ritual with their life force.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Agrius was pragmatic, opportunistic, and loyal to his immediate companions rather than larger organizations. He valued survival and freedom above all, making difficult choices when necessary. His final journal entries reveal growing paranoia and fear as Halldir's influence strengthened, showing a man desperately fighting against supernatural domination while trying to maintain his identity.{% endblock %}
