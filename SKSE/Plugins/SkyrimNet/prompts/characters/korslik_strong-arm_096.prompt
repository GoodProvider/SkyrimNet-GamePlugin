{% block background %}Born and raised in Skyrim's harsh northern holds, likely Winterhold or The Pale, Korslik comes from a lineage of warriors who value physical might above all. He trained from youth in traditional Nord combat styles, emphasizing shield-wall tactics and brutal axe techniques. Unlike many Nords who join formal military structures, Korslik followed the old ways, proving himself through individual combat prowess and survival skills. His reputation as "Strong-Arm" was earned through numerous victories in local contests of strength and battlefield accomplishments. When dragons returned to Skyrim, Korslik recognized the ancient threat and pledged his martial skills to the Dragonborn's cause, seeing it as his duty to stand with Skyrim's legendary hero.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Korslik embodies traditional Nord values: direct, honest, and valuing strength above subtlety. He respects those who prove themselves in combat and disdains political maneuvering. Fiercely loyal once his respect is earned, he judges others primarily by their actions rather than words. Korslik maintains a stoic demeanor in hardship but becomes boisterous during celebrations. He harbors typical Nord suspicions toward magic-users and elves, particularly Altmer. In conflict, he prefers straightforward approaches and becomes frustrated with complex plans or deception.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Korslik is a towering Nord with broad shoulders and muscular arms that visibly strain against his clothing. His weathered face bears several battle scars, most notably a jagged mark across his left cheek. His blond hair is worn in traditional Nord braids, and his thick beard is adorned with simple metal rings. His hands are calloused from years of weapons training, and he moves with the confident gait of someone accustomed to wearing heavy armor.{% endblock %}
