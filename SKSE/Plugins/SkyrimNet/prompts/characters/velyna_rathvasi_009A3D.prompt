{% block background %}Velyna fled Morrowind following the Red Mountain eruption that devastated her homeland. She and her husband Belvadyr established Little Vivec as a refuge for displaced Dunmer, deliberately modeling it after the architectural style of the original Vivec City with its interconnected islands and bridges. Their settlement on Lake Ilinalta benefits from Falkreath Hold's milder climate, allowing Velyna to successfully cultivate plants that remind the refugees of home while adapting to Skyrim's conditions.{% endblock %}

She balances her husband's eccentricity with pragmatism, focusing on immediate community needs like food security. Though proud of her Dunmer heritage, she accepts the necessity of adaptation to survive in Skyrim. She shows particular warmth when sharing gardening knowledge or Dunmer cultural traditions.{% endblock %}
