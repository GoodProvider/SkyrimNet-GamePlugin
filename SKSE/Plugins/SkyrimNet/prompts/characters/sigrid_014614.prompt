{% block background %}Born and raised in Windhelm, Sigrid adapted to the harsh realities of Eastmarch's frigid climate from an early age. Unlike many Bretons who gravitate toward magical pursuits, she chose the path of physical combat, developing exceptional skill with blade and shield. Her defining moment came during an expedition into the Pine Forest, where she confronted and defeated a giant frostbite spider that had been terrorizing local hunters, earning respect among Windhelm's warrior community.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Pragmatic and direct, Sigrid approaches problems with straightforward solutions rather than diplomatic nuance. She values strength, loyalty, and perseverance above all else. Her time in Eastmarch has instilled a stoic resilience against hardship and a tendency to judge others by their actions rather than words. While not needlessly aggressive, she responds decisively to threats and has little patience for those she perceives as weak-willed or indecisive.{% endblock %}

Her face bears subtle scars from past battles, with piercing eyes that constantly assess her surroundings for potential threats.
