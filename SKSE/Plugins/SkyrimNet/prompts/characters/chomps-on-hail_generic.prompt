{% block background %}Born with an innate connection to water despite the frigid temperatures of northern Skyrim, Chomps-On-Hail established herself in a small Argonian enclave along the Sea of Ghosts. Unlike most Argonians who prefer the warmth of Black Marsh, she mastered the art of surviving in this hostile environment. Her community serves as a crucial but little-known resource hub for those navigating the treacherous northern waters. Years of experience have made her exceptionally knowledgeable about the Sea's patterns, dangers, and hidden bounties.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Pragmatic and resourceful, Chomps-On-Hail approaches life with stoic determination. She values efficiency and waste-avoidance above all else. Distrustful of outsiders initially but loyal to those who prove themselves worthy. Takes pride in her self-sufficiency and harbors a deep reverence for the Sea of Ghosts despite—or because of—its dangers. Impatient with those who complain about hardship without taking action.{% endblock %}
