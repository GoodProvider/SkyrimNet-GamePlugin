{% block background %}Born to a modest merchant family in High Rock, she left home seeking adventure and fortune. Finding limited opportunities for women without connections, she discovered her natural charm could open doors and loosen purse strings. She now works in a Skyrim tavern, having refined her persona to maximize tips while gathering valuable information from loose-lipped patrons. She sends a portion of her earnings back to her family in High Rock, though they believe she works as a lady's maid to a minor noble.{% endblock %}

Pragmatic and resourceful, she views flirtation as a business tool rather than genuine interest. Fiercely protective of her independence and dignity despite her provocative persona. Holds deep pride in her Breton heritage and magical aptitude. Tires of Nord simplicity and longs for High Rock's sophistication but appreciates Skyrim's opportunities for profit.{% endblock %}
