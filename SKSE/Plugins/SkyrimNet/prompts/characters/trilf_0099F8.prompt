{% block background %}Trilf served in the Imperial Legion alongside his older brother Steirod. After completing their military service, they pooled their savings to purchase Frost River Mill in western Hjaalmarch, a marshy region known for its difficult terrain and proximity to Morthal. The investment initially proved costly, putting them in debt, but they've committed to civilian life and slowly rebuilding their finances through lumber production. Their mill serves the sparse settlements of Hjaalmarch, providing timber for construction and firewood for the cold Skyrim winters.{% endblock %}
