{% block background %}Born and raised in Eastmarch, he settled in Kynesgrove to farm the volcanic soil that remains fertile despite the harsh climate. For years, he's supplied food to the miners and travelers visiting Braidwood Inn. Recently, his livelihood has been threatened by a group of bandits posing as knights who demand "protection fees" from local businesses. With Windhelm's forces focused on the Civil War and Kynesgrove's minimal guard presence, he fears losing everything he's worked for.{% endblock %}
