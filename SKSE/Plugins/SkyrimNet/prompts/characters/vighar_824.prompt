{% block background %}Vighar was once a member of Falkreath's noble lineage centuries ago before embracing vampirism. He established Bloodlet Throne as his seat of power in the mountains, gathering lesser vampires under his command. His direct descendants now rule Falkreath, though they disavow their vampiric ancestor. He maintains the fortress as both sanctuary and hunting ground, using the arena for blood sport entertainment.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Vighar is coldly aristocratic, viewing mortals as entertainment and sustenance rather than equals. He possesses the arrogance of extreme age and power, speaking with casual disdain about life and death. He maintains formal Nord traditions twisted through a vampiric lens, valuing strength, dominance, and the preservation of bloodlines. He is calculating, patient, and utterly remorseless.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Vighar appears as an elderly Nord with the pallid complexion of advanced vampirism. His eyes glow with an unnatural red hunger, and his features are gaunt and predatory. Despite his age, he moves with unnatural grace and strength, his fingers ending in claw-like nails.{% endblock %}
