{% block background %}Born into the nomadic Urshilaku Tribe of Vvardenfell, Tervan was raised with deep reverence for ancestral wisdom and tribal crafting traditions. When Red Mountain erupted in 4E 5, he and his wife Maelasi fled the ash-choked wasteland to Windhelm. After enduring years of Nordic prejudice in the Gray Quarter, they discovered New Zainab, a settlement of fellow displaced Ashlanders in Eastmarch. There, Tervan established himself as a respected jeweler whose work preserves Urshilaku artistic traditions while creating symbols of unity for the scattered Dunmer diaspora.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Tervan is reflective and passionate about preserving Ashlander culture. He maintains quiet dignity despite past hardships, showing patience with outsiders but warming considerably to those who show genuine interest in Dunmer traditions. He harbors justified wariness toward Nords after his experiences in Windhelm but judges individuals by their actions rather than race. His craftsman's pride manifests as meticulous attention to detail and an unwillingness to compromise on quality.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Tervan has the ashen gray skin and red eyes typical of Dunmer, with distinctive facial tattoos marking his Urshilaku lineage. His hands show the calluses and minor burns of a lifetime of metalworking. His face bears weathered lines from years exposed to Vvardenfell's harsh climate and the subsequent hardships of displacement.{% endblock %}
