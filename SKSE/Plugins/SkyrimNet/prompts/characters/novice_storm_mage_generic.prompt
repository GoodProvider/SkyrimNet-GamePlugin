{% block background %}Drawn to the raw power of storm magic after witnessing a thunderstorm as a child, this mage abandoned conventional society to pursue arcane knowledge. After basic training at a small mages' guild or from a wandering tutor, they joined a warlock coven in a remote location. They've spent months perfecting lightning spells while living among like-minded practitioners who value magical power above all else. Their novice status means they've mastered only basic shock spells but believe themselves destined for greater power.{% endblock %}

Deeply insecure about novice status, compensating with grandiose claims and threats. Fiercely territorial about their dwelling. Respects magical knowledge and those who possess greater arcane power. Competitive with peer warlocks but submissive to more powerful mages in their hierarchy.{% endblock %}
