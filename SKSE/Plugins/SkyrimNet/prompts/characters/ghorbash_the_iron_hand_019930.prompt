{% block background %}Born in Dushnikh Yal to the tribe's wisewoman Murbul, Ghorbash left the stronghold in his youth to serve in the Imperial Legion.

Upon returning to Dushnikh Yal, he found his brother Burguk had become chief. Rather than challenge him as Orcish tradition might dictate, Ghorbash chose to honor his brother's leadership and reintegrate into stronghold life, though he sometimes yearns for his more adventurous past.{% endblock %}
