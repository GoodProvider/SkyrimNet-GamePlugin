{% block background %}Hillevi runs the Cruel-Sea family market stall in Windhelm, selling produce from their Hollyfrost Farm. She lives with her husband Torsten and young son Grimvar in the prestigious Valunstrad district. Their daughter Fjotli was murdered by the Butcher several months ago, a tragedy she shares with the Shatter-Shield family who lost Friga to the same killer. Despite her grief, Hillevi maintains her business and family responsibilities. The Cruel-Seas employ Tulvur to manage their farm across the river and Idesa Sadri, a Dunmer woman, as Grimvar's nanny.{% endblock %}
