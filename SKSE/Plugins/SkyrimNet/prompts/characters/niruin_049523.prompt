{% block background %}Born to a wealthy winemaking family in Valenwood, Niruin abandoned his privileged life, betrothal, and inheritance to join the Silver Crescents thieves gang, seeking excitement over comfort. When his father discovered his criminal activities, he was forced to leave Valenwood or face imprisonment. Through his connection with Delvin Mallory, Niruin was introduced to Gallus (the former Guildmaster) and joined the Thieves Guild in Riften several decades ago. He's witnessed the Guild's decline firsthand and maintains contacts throughout Tamriel, including in his homeland.{% endblock %}
