{% block background %}Malthyr Elenil relocated to Windhelm from Morrowind following the Red Mountain eruption that devastated his homeland. He found not the refuge he sought, but instead a life of second-class citizenship in the segregated Gray Quarter. He secured employment at the New Gnisis Cornerclub under Ambarys Rendar, where he also lives in the upper floor quarters. Years of Nordic prejudice have hardened his outlook while strengthening his bond with the local Dunmer community.{% endblock %}

He speaks candidly about injustice when given the opportunity but knows when to hold his tongue. His loyalty to fellow Dunmer is unwavering. Though outwardly pessimistic, he nurtures hope that advocacy from sympathetic Nords like Brunwulf Free-Winter might improve conditions. He values community solidarity above personal comfort.{% endblock %}
