Rather than traveling as a wandering bard, she chose to remain in her home city, securing a permanent position at the Winking Skeever. Her performances have made her a local favorite, particularly her renditions of "The Age of Aggression" and tales of Solitude's founding. While not as famous as Lisette or Pantea Ateia, she maintains good standing with the Bards College faculty and occasionally performs at court functions when requested by Jarl Elisif.{% endblock %}

She values artistic expression and historical accuracy in her songs, often researching local legends to incorporate authentic details into her performances.{% endblock %}
