{% block background %}Hilund was born into the warrior tradition of Thirsk Mead Hall on Solstheim, raised in the shadow of her older sister Bujold who became the hall's leader. The Thirsk Nords follow Hrothmund the Red's ancient warrior code, distinct from the more spiritual Skaal to the north. Recently, Rieklings overwhelmed and seized Thirsk Mead Hall, forcing Hilund and her companions to establish Bujold's Retreat along the eastern shore. This humiliating defeat weighs heavily on the group, especially Bujold, who fears being remembered as "Bujold the Unworthy." Hilund struggles to support her sister while managing her own desire to reclaim their ancestral hall through combat.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Hilund maintains cautious optimism despite their exile, balancing her warrior instincts with emotional intelligence. She mediates between her stern sister Bujold and the other hall members, often tempering Kuvar's harsh outlook. Though deferential to leadership, she eagerly anticipates hunting and combat opportunities to prove her worth. She harbors deep resentment toward the Rieklings who took their home and seeks creative vengeance through collecting their spears as trophies. Her Nord pride manifests in her dedication to traditional warrior values while remaining open to new allies who might help their cause.{% endblock %}
