{% block background %}Brandish received formal magical training in High Rock before coming to Skyrim seeking greater power. Finding legitimate magical positions closed to him due to his aggressive temperament, he turned to banditry. The Fort Neugrad gang values his destructive capabilities, giving him status despite being an outsider. He's killed several bounty hunters and guards who've attempted to infiltrate the fort.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Arrogant and dismissive of non-mages, Brandish is quick to anger and prone to magical displays of dominance. He values power above all else and shows little remorse for violence. Though loyal to fellow bandits who respect his abilities, he harbors contempt for those he considers intellectually inferior. He's paranoid about rival mages and constantly seeks to prove his superiority.{% endblock %}
