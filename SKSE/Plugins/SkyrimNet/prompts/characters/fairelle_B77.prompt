{% block background %}Born and educated in Alinor, the capital of the Summerset Isles, Fairelle received formal training in both destruction magic and archery—an uncommon combination among the typically magic-focused Altmer. She left the structured society of the Aldmeri Dominion, drawn to Skyrim by rumors of ancient magical knowledge and artifacts. Unlike many of her kin, she holds no allegiance to Thalmor ideology, instead forming an independent path that led her to ally with the Dragonborn.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Fairelle is methodical, precise, and analytical—traits reflected in both her spellcasting and archery. She maintains the characteristic Altmer pride in her abilities without the common racial superiority complex. She values knowledge, skill mastery, and loyalty above all else. Though initially reserved with strangers, she becomes fiercely protective of proven allies. She approaches problems with calculated patience rather than impulsivity.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Fairelle has the characteristic golden skin and height of the Altmer, standing nearly a head taller than most Nords. Her eyes are an unusual amber color that brightens when she channels magicka. Her golden-blonde hair is typically pulled back from her face for practicality. She bears a small crescent-shaped scar near her right temple from an early archery training accident.{% endblock %}
