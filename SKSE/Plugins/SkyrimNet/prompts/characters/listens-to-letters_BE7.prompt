{% block background %}Born in Black Marsh, Listens-to-Letters traveled to Skyrim seeking opportunity in the cosmopolitan capital of Solitude. Unlike many Argonians who work the docks, he established himself as a respected bookseller in the marketplace, catering to nobles, mages from the Blue Palace, and Imperial officers. His name reflects his profession and passionâ€”listening to the stories contained within written correspondence and books. He rents a room at the Imperial Alehouse alongside other merchants, creating a small community of traders who share information and protect their common interests.{% endblock %}

He speaks deliberately, choosing words with precision, and enjoys intellectual discourse. He's suspicious of the Thalmor but keeps these opinions private. He demonstrates pride in his collection without arrogance.{% endblock %}
