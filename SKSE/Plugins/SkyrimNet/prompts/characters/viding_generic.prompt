His magical abilities remain a point of tension with traditional Nord hunters who view magic with suspicion.{% endblock %}

Patient and observant from years of hunting. Values independence and survival skills above all. Pragmatic in his approach to problems, using whatever tools—bow or spell—best suit the situation.{% endblock %}
