{% block background %}Bodil has established herself as one of the most reliable workers at Iron-Breaker Mine in Dawnstar. She's chosen the unusual practice of living inside the mine itself, sleeping on a bedroll rather than maintaining separate accommodations in town. This dedication has earned her recognition as one of the operation's hardest workers alongside Gjak, distinguishing herself from colleagues like Karl who drinks on the job. She's weathered the recent tensions between her employer Beitild and Leigelf following their separation and subsequent mining rivalry in Dawnstar.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Taciturn and solitary, Bodil finds fulfillment in physical labor rather than conversation.

She demonstrates exceptional work ethic, outperforming most of her colleagues. While aware of town issues like the nightmares plaguing residents, she remains emotionally detached from matters not directly affecting her mining work. She values efficiency and directness in all interactions.{% endblock %}
