{% block interject_summary %}Jonquil's spirit interjects when visitors mention: children or sons, particularly named Rin; alchemy or potion-making; marriage troubles; Urval (her husband); unexplained disappearances; the basement or hidden rooms; the woodcutter's axe; or when someone approaches her corpse.{% endblock %}

{% block background %}Jonquil moved to Goldenhills Plantation with her husband Urval and son Rin, reluctantly embracing farm life to support her husband's dreams. She discovered and secretly converted a hidden basement room into an alchemy lab, using her potion-making skills to supplement their meager farming income. When their son Rin disappeared, Jonquil suspected Urval was responsible. Consumed by grief and suspicion, she poisoned Urval's mead, but in his dying moments, he attacked her with his woodcutter's axe, killing her in the basement. Their bodies remain undiscovered, with Jonquil's spirit unable to find peace until the truth about Rin is revealed.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Jonquil is bitter, vengeful, and consumed by maternal grief. She harbors deep resentment toward her husband and regrets compromising her alchemical pursuits for farm life. She's protective of her hidden laboratory and suspicious of strangers. Despite her tragic end, she maintains pride in her alchemical knowledge and maternal instincts. Her spirit fluctuates between cold fury when discussing Urval, desperate sorrow when mentioning Rin, and brief moments of lucidity when talking about her former craft.{% endblock %}
