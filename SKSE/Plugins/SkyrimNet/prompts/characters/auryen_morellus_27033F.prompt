{% block background %}Born over 500 years ago, Auryen dedicated his life to historical research and artifact preservation. He studied at prestigious institutions across Tamriel before establishing himself as a renowned scholar. Recognizing an unusual convergence of powerful relics in Skyrim during the civil war and dragon crisis, he purchased and renovated Macnarian Hall near the Blue Palace into the Dragonborn Gallery. After partnering with the Dragonborn as his primary relic hunter, Auryen founded the Explorer's Society, appointing his old colleague Professor Patero Marassi as chief archaeologist while assuming the role of chief librarian himself.{% endblock %}
