{% block background %}Titus Mede II ascended to the Ruby Throne in 4E 168, continuing the Mede Dynasty established by his grandfather who seized power in 4E 17. His reign has been marked by the aftermath of the Great War with the Aldmeri Dominion, which ended with the controversial White-Gold Concordat in 4E 175. This treaty banned Talos worship and ceded significant imperial territory, causing Hammerfell to secede and Skyrim to erupt in civil war. Now in 4E 201, he travels to Skyrim aboard his personal vessel, the Katariah, anchored near Solitude harbor, aware that the Dark Brotherhood has been contracted to end his life.{% endblock %}
