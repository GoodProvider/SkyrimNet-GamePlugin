{% block background %}Verin built his fortune through a long-standing business partnership, secretly skimming profits through accounting manipulation. His wealth allowed him to cultivate connections across Morrowind and Skyrim. Recently summoned to Bloodchill Cavern by his former partner, he traveled from warmer southern regions to this remote northern location, joining other affluent guests for what he expects to be a lucrative networking opportunity. The continued absence of their host has begun to unsettle him.{% endblock %}

He exhibits cultural elitism typical of older Dunmer, particularly toward Nords. Outwardly charming and sociable, he constantly evaluates situations for potential gain while concealing his fraudulent tendencies behind impeccable manners.{% endblock %}
