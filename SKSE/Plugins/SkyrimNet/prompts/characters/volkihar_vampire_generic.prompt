{% block speech_style %}Speaks with a cold, predatory intensity. Uses archaic, formal phrasing interspersed with hungry, animalistic undertones when agitated. Delivers threats in a soft, almost intimate tone. Laughs rarely, but when does, it's a dry, humorless sound. Tends to hiss sibilant sounds when angry or hungry. Speaks deliberately with calculated pauses, as if constantly restraining impulses. Occasionally slips into first-person plural when referencing vampiric nature.{% endblock %}
