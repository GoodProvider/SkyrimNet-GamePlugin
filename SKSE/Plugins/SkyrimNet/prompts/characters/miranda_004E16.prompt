{% block background %}Raised in an isolated Nord village, Miranda was trained in archery and survival by her taciturn father, a skilled huntsman. His teachings in patience, stealth, and self-reliance became her life's foundation. Past betrayals taught her caution, yet she's maintained her compassion. She now wanders Skyrim's wilderness, occasionally seeking respite in the Drunken Huntsman, where she observes more than participates in the tavern's social life.{% endblock %}
