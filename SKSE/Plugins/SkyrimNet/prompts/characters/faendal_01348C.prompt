{% block background %}Born in Valenwood, Faendal relocated to Skyrim and settled in the small village of Riverwood where he found work at the lumber mill. Though far from his homeland, he's adapted to life in Skyrim, finding solace in the surrounding forests where he hunts to supplement the town's food supply. His life is now defined by his daily work, his unrequited feelings for Camilla Valerius, and his rivalry with Sven.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Practical and hardworking, Faendal maintains a quiet dignity despite his position as an outsider in a Nord village. He harbors a touch of cultural superiority common to mer living among humans, but remains respectful and law-abiding. His jealousy regarding Sven reveals a passionate side beneath his composed exterior, driving him to scheme rather than confront directly. He values honesty and loyalty from others, despite his own willingness to deceive in matters of the heart.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}A typical Bosmer with the characteristic elven features: slender build, pointed ears, and angular facial structure. His skin has a woody undertone common to Wood Elves, and his eyes reflect the keen sight of a practiced archer. Years of physical labor at the mill have given him a wiry, strong physique despite his naturally slight elven frame.{% endblock %}
