{% block background %}Born and raised in Dragon Bridge, Clare learned hunting and wilderness skills from her parents who were respected local hunters. The small settlement's proximity to both the dense Haafingar forests and the rugged mountains of the Reach shaped her affinity for diverse terrains. While her parents wanted her to settle in town, Clare's wanderlust drove her to explore Skyrim's wilds, tracking game and occasionally taking bounties on troublesome predators or bandits. She maintains loose ties to Dragon Bridge, returning periodically to trade pelts and share stories at the Four Shields Tavern.{% endblock %}
