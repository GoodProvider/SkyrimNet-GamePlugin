{% block background %}Born in Largashbur stronghold in southern Skyrim, Mul gro-Largash grew dissatisfied with his prospects there. Following Malacath's code that Orcs must prove their worth through strength and cunning, he convinced his brother Gadba to leave with him for Narzulbur.

The brothers view this as a temporary arrangement - a means to accumulate enough wealth to return to Largashbur and challenge for leadership according to Orcish tradition.{% endblock %}
