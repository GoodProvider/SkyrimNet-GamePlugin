{% block background %}Born and raised in High Rock among Bretons, Eomir grew up as a cultural outsider. His life changed when he witnessed a traveling Nord warrior defeat a dangerous threat to his town. This formative experience instilled in him deep respect for Nord martial traditions. He eventually journeyed to Skyrim to reconnect with his ancestral heritage, settling in Whiterun due to the city's prominence in warrior culture and the presence of the Companions at Jorrvaskr. Though not a formal member of the Companions, he trains near their hall and frequents the Bannered Mare, where he shares stories of Nord heroes with patrons.{% endblock %}
