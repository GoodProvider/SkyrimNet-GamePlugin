{% block background %}Virginia was born and raised in Skyrim's harsh northern reaches. She trained with the Companions in her youth but never formally joined their ranks, preferring independence. She fought in numerous skirmishes against bandits and participated in border conflicts before settling in Dawnstar.

She now trains local guards and miners in combat techniques while serving as an unofficial sentinel against threats from the Sea of Ghosts and surrounding wilderness.{% endblock %}
