{% block background %}Nenya has served as steward of Falkreath for generations, originally appointed by Dengeir of Stuhn in his youth. When Dengeir's health declined, his nephew Siddgeir was appointed Jarl, and Nenya remained steward for continuity. With Siddgeir showing little interest in governance, Nenya has become the de facto ruler, managing Falkreath's lumber-based economy, overseeing trade routes disrupted by the civil war, and maintaining the town's famous cemetery. She supports the Empire in the civil war, working closely with Housecarl Helvard on security matters.{% endblock %}
