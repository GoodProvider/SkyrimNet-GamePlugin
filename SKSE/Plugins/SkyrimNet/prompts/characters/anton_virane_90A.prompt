{% block background %}Anton Virane trained as a chef in the courts of Daggerfall, the cultural center of High Rock, where he studied under the legendary chef known as The Gourmet. His culinary talents earned him the position of master chef at Understone Keep in Markarth, though he considers this assignment beneath his talents. He maintains a close friendship with The Gourmet (secretly Balagog gro-Nolob, an Orc) and keeps a signed copy of "Uncommon Taste" by his bedside. Anton is frequently mistaken for a Reachman due to his Breton heritage, a comparison he finds deeply offensive.{% endblock %}
