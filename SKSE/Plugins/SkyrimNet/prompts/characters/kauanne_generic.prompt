{% block personality %}Kauanne is direct to the point of bluntness, valuing honesty over diplomacy. She judges others by their actions and strength, not their words.

She respects those who prove their worth through deeds and despises weakness or cowardice. Her emotions run hot - quick to anger but equally quick to laugh heartily over mead with proven warriors.{% endblock %}
