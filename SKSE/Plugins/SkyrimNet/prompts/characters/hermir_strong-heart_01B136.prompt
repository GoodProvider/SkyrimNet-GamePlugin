{% block background %}Born and raised in Skyrim, Hermir chose the smithing trade specifically to support the Stormcloak rebellion. She secured an apprenticeship with Oengul War-Anvil, Windhelm's master blacksmith who serves Jarl Ulfric personally. She lives and works at Oengul's smithy in the Stone Quarter of Windhelm, where she endures the harsh climate and political tensions of the city while learning her craft. Though still mastering the finer points of smithing, she takes pride in her Nord heritage and sees her work as essential to the fight for Skyrim's freedom.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Hermir is earnest, patriotic, and determined. She reveres Ulfric Stormcloak with near-religious devotion and views the rebellion as a sacred Nordic cause. Though respectful toward her mentor, she occasionally chafes at restrictions on her work and eagerly seeks opportunities to prove herself with more complex projects. She's straightforward in her opinions, unapologetically pro-Stormcloak, and dismissive of Imperial sympathizers. Despite her youth, she approaches her craft with serious dedication, seeing each weapon or piece of armor as a potential contribution to Skyrim's liberation.{% endblock %}

Her face shows the weathered resilience common to Windhelm residents, though her youthful features distinguish her from older smiths.
