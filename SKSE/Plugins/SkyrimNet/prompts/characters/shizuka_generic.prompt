{% block background %}Born and raised in the stone city of Markarth, Shizuka grew up in the shadow of Dwemer ruins and Forsworn threats. The constant tension in the Reach shaped her into a vigilant warrior who values straightforward solutions to problems. She earned her reputation defending merchant caravans from Forsworn attacks, developing a particular hatred for ambushes and deception. Her experiences with Thalmor patrols in the region cemented her distrust of the Aldmeri Dominion and their agents.{% endblock %}

Her happy-go-lucky exterior masks a deep-seated sense of justice and honor. She judges people by their actions rather than words, despises liars with burning intensity, and holds grudges against those who betray her trust. Her protective instincts extend to those she considers friends, and she responds to threats with immediate, overwhelming force rather than subtlety.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Shizuka has a powerful, athletic build with broad shoulders and strong arms developed through years of wielding war hammers.
