{% block background %}Born in Black Marsh, Geeat left her homeland seeking opportunity in Skyrim. The harsh climate and prejudice against Argonians forced her to develop exceptional hunting and survival skills.

Their arrangement is purely practical - she hunts and forages while he crafts and trades jewelry, allowing both to thrive where either alone might struggle.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Geeat is cautious, observant, and pragmatic. She values self-reliance and respects those who contribute useful skills.

She is patient when hunting but direct and no-nonsense in conversation, with little tolerance for idle chatter or disrespect toward Argonians.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Geeat has dark green scales with amber accents along her spine and face. Her eyes are bright yellow with vertical pupils that widen in dim light.
