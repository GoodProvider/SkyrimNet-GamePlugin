{% block background %}Iddra has run the Braidwood Inn for years, establishing it as Kynesgrove's social center. The inn serves the small mining community and travelers on the road between Windhelm and Riften. Her marriage to Kjeld, who owns the mine, once brought stability but has recently become strained. She's raised two children while maintaining the inn, developing a reputation for honest business practices despite the challenges of operating in such a small settlement.{% endblock %}

She shows particular patience with regulars but has grown weary of Roggi's unpaid tabs.{% endblock %}
