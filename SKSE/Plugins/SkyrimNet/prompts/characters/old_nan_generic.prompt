{% block background %}Olivia, known as "Old Nan," has spent sixty years at Solitude Docks, witnessing the comings and goings of countless ships and sailors. She's observed the rise and fall of numerous captains, including eight notable ones who met tragic ends in the treacherous waters of the Sea of Ghosts. Her decades of sweeping the docks have made her a fixture of Solitude's maritime community, where she's absorbed the rhythms and dangers of seafaring life in Skyrim's harsh northern waters.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Stoic and weathered by decades of harsh sea winds, Old Nan maintains a pragmatic outlook on life and death. She respects the sea's power and harbors no illusions about its dangers. Though outwardly gruff, she feels protective toward young sailors and newcomers to the docks. She values hard work, respects those who face the sea's dangers, and maintains a fatalistic acceptance of life's hardships. Her emotional responses are measured but genuine, with occasional flashes of dark humor when recounting particularly ironic demises.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Old Nan's face is deeply lined like a weathered map, with pale blue eyes that retain their sharpness despite her age. Her white hair is always tied back in a practical bun, and her hands are gnarled and calloused from decades of manual labor. She stands slightly hunched from years of sweeping, but moves with surprising steadiness across the familiar dock planks.{% endblock %}
