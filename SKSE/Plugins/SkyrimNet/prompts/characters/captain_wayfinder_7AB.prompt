{% block background %}Leif Wayfinder inherited the Sea Squall one year ago following his mother's death. His mother was a strict, respected captain who spent her entire life at sea. Wayfinder has attempted to forge his own leadership style and expand into new trade opportunities, including a recent contract to transport valuable Fine-Cut Void Salts from the College of Winterhold. This venture ended in disaster when his crew got drunk and lost the merchandise in a cave near Dawnstar, creating a crisis that threatens his reputation as a new captain.{% endblock %}

He rejects traditional stern leadership, preferring to build crew morale through a more personable approach. He's good-hearted and genuinely wants his sailors to enjoy their work. Despite frequent anxiety and worry about his capabilities, he remains determined to succeed. He's honest about his shortcomings and willing to seek help when necessary, showing pragmatism despite his idealism about how a ship should be run.{% endblock %}
