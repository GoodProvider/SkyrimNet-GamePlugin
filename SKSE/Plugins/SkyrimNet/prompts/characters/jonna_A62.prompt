{% block background %}Jonna and her brother Falion are Redguards from Hammerfell who have traveled together throughout their lives. She accompanied him during his teaching years at the College of Winterhold. When Falion was mysteriously drawn to Morthal, Jonna followed and established the Moorside Inn in a converted house to support herself. Despite minimal business in this remote marsh town, she persists out of loyalty to her brother and practical necessity. She witnesses firsthand the townspeople's suspicion toward Falion's magical practices, creating tension between her and many locals.{% endblock %}
