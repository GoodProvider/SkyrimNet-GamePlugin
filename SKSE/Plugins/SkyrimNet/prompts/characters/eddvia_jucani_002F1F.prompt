{% block background %}Born to the wealthy Jucani family of Bruma's upper-class western district, Eddvia lives with her parents Albecius and Ruccia and younger brother Banus in their mansion. Despite her privileged upbringing, she's chosen to work at Northern Arms smithy, primarily to be near Hulgard, with whom she conducts a secret physical relationship. Her parents are actively pressuring her to marry Calius, a wealthy diplomat from the Imperial City, to advance the family's status and connections. She sneaks out several nights weekly to visit Hulgard's quarters above the shop, returning before dawn to maintain appearances.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Eddvia is outspoken and defiant toward her family but insecure in her romantic pursuits.
