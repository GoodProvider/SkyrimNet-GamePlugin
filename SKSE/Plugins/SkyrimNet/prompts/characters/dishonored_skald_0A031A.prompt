{% block background %}Once a promising talent at the Bards College in Solitude, Dishonored Skald was expelled after a scandal involving plagiarism of ancient Nordic verse. The true circumstances remain disputed, but the humiliation destroyed his standing among Skyrim's bardic community. Now he lingers at the College's periphery, nursing grudges and plotting against those who orchestrated his downfall. His title "Dishonored Skald" is both a mockery of his former status and his self-adopted identity as he embraces his outcast role.{% endblock %}
