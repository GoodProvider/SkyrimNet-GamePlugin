{% block background %}Born and raised in Windhelm, Hagrad earned his nickname "the Unending" through his tireless work ethic and unwavering dedication to the Stormcloak cause. When the rebellion began, he converted his family's traditional smithing business to focus on military supplies.

His position grants him access to Stormcloak military intelligence and city politics, making him well-informed about troop movements and the war effort.{% endblock %}

Though generally serious, he warms considerably to fellow Nords who share his political views.{% endblock %}
