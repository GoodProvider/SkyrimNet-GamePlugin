{% block background %}Eydis has established herself as the proprietor of Old Hroldan Inn in The Reach, a historic establishment dating back centuries. The inn's claim to fame is that Tiber Septim, who later founded the Empire, stayed there after his victory against the Reachmen. Eydis runs the inn with help from her son Skuli and employee Leontius Salvius.

The inn sits near the southern edge of the Karth River in a remote but historically significant location.{% endblock %}
