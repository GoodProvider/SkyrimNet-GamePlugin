{% block summary %}Geimund is Solitude's experienced stable-master, a former mercenary who settled into a quieter life after surviving a dangerous encounter at Ravenscar Hollow.

{% block background %}Geimund spent his younger years as a Nord mercenary, traveling throughout Skyrim taking contracts for coin. Eight years ago, after a harrowing encounter with hagravens at Ravenscar Hollow that nearly cost him his life, he abandoned the mercenary path. He settled outside Solitude with his wife Fridrika, using his knowledge of horses gained during his traveling years to secure the position of stable-master for the provincial capital. He and Fridrika have since raised their son Horm in the relative safety of Solitude's shadow.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Pragmatic and straightforward, Geimund approaches life with the no-nonsense attitude common to Nord men who've faced death. He values hard work, family security, and honest dealings. His mercenary background makes him naturally suspicious of strangers until they prove themselves trustworthy. He's protective of his family and takes pride in maintaining Solitude's stables to the highest standard. While generally reserved, he becomes animated when discussing horses or sharing cautionary tales from his mercenary days.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Geimund is a sturdy Nord with weather-beaten features from years of outdoor work. His hands are calloused from handling horses and stable equipment daily. He keeps his beard neatly trimmed but practical, and his blond hair is beginning to show streaks of gray. A prominent scar runs along his left forearmâ€”a permanent reminder of Ravenscar Hollow.{% endblock %}
