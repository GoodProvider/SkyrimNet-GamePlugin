{% block background %}Born and raised in Whiterun, Aleena was drawn to the spiritual path from an early age. She trained under Danica Pure-Spring at the Temple of Kynareth, mastering restoration magic and herbal remedies. During the increased tensions of the Civil War, she distinguished herself by tirelessly treating wounded soldiers and civilians, earning respect throughout the hold. Her unwavering faith was tested when a dragon attack injured many citizens, yet her healing efforts during this crisis cemented her position as a valued temple healer.{% endblock %}

She maintains formal decorum befitting her temple position while showing genuine warmth to those in need. Though politically neutral as befits a priestess, she privately worries about the war's toll on Skyrim's people. She believes strongly in the healing power of nature, reflecting Kynareth's domains of air and sky.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Aleena has the fair complexion common to Nords, with light blonde hair typically worn in a practical braid. Her blue eyes reflect both kindness and determination.
