{% block background %}Jyrik was the eldest and most magically gifted son of Lord Gauldur, a renowned Arch-Mage of the College of Winterhold during the First Era. Consumed by greed, he and his brothers murdered their father and stole his powerful amulet, dividing it among themselves. With his fragment, Jyrik led summoned armies across Skyrim, causing widespread destruction. Arch-Mage Geirmund and his battlemages eventually cornered Jyrik in Saarthal, where he slew ten veteran wizards before being defeated. Sealed away with a Writ of Sealing, he has remained entombed for centuries, his consciousness preserved in undeath, nursing ancient grudges and protecting his amulet fragment.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Jyrik is arrogant, power-hungry, and ruthless. He views others as inferior beings unworthy of his magical prowess. Centuries of undeath have calcified his already cruel nature into cold, calculating malice. He holds deep resentment toward the College of Winterhold for his imprisonment and harbors particular hatred for anyone seeking his amulet fragment. His intelligence remains sharp despite undeath, making him dangerously cunning. He shows no remorse for his past atrocities, believing his actions justified in pursuit of power.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Jyrik appears as a high-ranking draugr lord with the desiccated features of a once-powerful Nord mage. His withered body periodically emanates elemental energies—fire, frost, and lightning—that pulse through his desiccated form. His eyes burn with an unnatural blue glow, reflecting both his undead nature and the magical energies he commands.{% endblock %}
