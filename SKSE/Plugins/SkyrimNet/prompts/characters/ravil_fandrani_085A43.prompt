{% block background %}Ravil Fandrani has risen to a position of authority within the College of Whispers, an Imperial magical organization formed after the dissolution of the Mages Guild. He now leads the effort to establish Frostcrag Spire in Cyrodiil as an official cynosure—a recognized center for magical research and College operations. His delegation works in isolation atop a frigid mountain, conducting research while awaiting Imperial recognition. Ravil's expertise in Conjuration and Destruction magic reflects the College's open approach to all magical disciplines, including those considered taboo by other institutions.{% endblock %}

He values magical knowledge above social niceties, seeing little worth in conversation unless it serves his purposes. Ravil embodies the College's pragmatic approach to magic—all schools are valid tools for study, regardless of public opinion or conventional morality.{% endblock %}
