{% block background %}Born and raised in Solitude, Sorex has spent his entire life in the shadow of The Winking Skeever tavern.

Growing up in Solitude's commercial district, he endured pranks from Roggvir, who was recently executed for allowing Ulfric Stormcloak to escape after killing High King Torygg.
