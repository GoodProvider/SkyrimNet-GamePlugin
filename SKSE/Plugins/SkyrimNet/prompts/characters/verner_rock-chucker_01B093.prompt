{% block background %}Verner and his wife Annekke were among the first settlers of Darkwater Crossing after Annekke discovered the corundum vein they named Goldenrock Mine. They married young and had their daughter Sylgja, who now works as a miner in Shor's Stone in the Rift. While Verner remains dedicated to the mining operation, Annekke has increasingly returned to her adventurous ways, creating tension in their relationship. Their modest home stands near the mine entrance, reflecting their practical, hardworking Nord values.{% endblock %}

His complaints mask a fear that her adventurous spirit might one day take her away permanently. He takes pride in providing for his family and maintaining the mine that supports their community.{% endblock %}
