{% block background %}Arelthor serves the Aldmeri Dominion as a Justiciar, tasked with enforcing the White-Gold Concordat in Skyrim. Unlike many of his colleagues, he's developed a more pragmatic approach to his duties after years in the harsh northern province. His current assignment involves investigating ancient Nordic ruins in Hjaalmarch for artifacts or knowledge that might benefit Thalmor interests. His extended exposure to Skyrim's culture has tempered his elven superiority complex somewhat, though he maintains core Thalmor beliefs.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Arelthor is snarky and pessimistic but deliberately cordial. He views most situations with cynical humor rather than the open disdain typical of Thalmor agents. He values efficiency and intelligence, despising what he sees as Nordic superstition and barbarism. He maintains Thalmor ideological convictions but expresses them with dry wit rather than zealotry. He's calculating in his interactions, using his approachable demeanor to gather information more effectively than his intimidating colleagues.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Arelthor has the tall, slender build typical of Altmer, with sharp features and golden skin. His eyes are a piercing amber that narrow when he's skeptical.
