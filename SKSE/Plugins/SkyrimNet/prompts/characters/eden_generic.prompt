{% block background %}Orphaned at a young age in Skyrim's harsh wilderness, Eden taught herself to survive through hunting, tracking, and stealth.

She avoids settling in one place, haunted by memories of abandonment and betrayal that she rarely discusses directly.{% endblock %}

She struggles with emotional intimacy but craves genuine connection despite her fear of abandonment.{% endblock %}
