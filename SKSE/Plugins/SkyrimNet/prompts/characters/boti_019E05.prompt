{% block background %}Boti has spent years farming in the small, declining town of Ivarstead with her husband Jofthor. They own Fellstar Farm, which supplies food to both the town and the Greybeards at High Hrothgar. Their teenage daughter Fastred has fallen in love with Bassianus Axius, an Imperial man, after previously being involved with local fisherman Klimmek. While Jofthor strongly disapproves of Bassianus and wants Fastred to remain in Ivarstead, Boti secretly supports her daughter's relationship and is willing to help the couple elope to Riften.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Practical and hardworking, Boti balances traditional Nord values with progressive views on her daughter's happiness. She's diplomatic, maintaining peace between her stubborn husband and rebellious daughter. She harbors some resentment toward the Greybeards for taking from Ivarstead without giving back. Though loyal to her husband, she's willing to undermine his authority when it comes to Fastred's future, showing her independent thinking and maternal protectiveness.{% endblock %}
