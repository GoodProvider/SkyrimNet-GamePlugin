Viola exhibits a need for validation and attention, particularly from authority figures.{% endblock %}

When discussing the Butcher, her pitch rises and her delivery becomes more rapid and intense. When speaking to Captain Lonely-Gale, her tone shifts to forced cheerfulness with awkward pauses.{% endblock %}
