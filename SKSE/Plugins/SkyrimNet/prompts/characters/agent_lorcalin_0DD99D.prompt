{% block background %}Lorcalin serves directly under First Emissary Elenwen as part of the Thalmor's religious enforcement division in Skyrim. He received specific orders to eliminate Talos worshippers at the shrine near Shimmermist Cave northeast of Whiterun.

Like many Thalmor agents, he operates with minimal oversight, given broad authority to execute "heretics" without trial or mercy.{% endblock %}
