{% block background %}Laura served in Whiterun's guard as a specialized ranger and scout for several years. Following an undisclosed incident that shattered her trust in authority, she abandoned her post and now lives as a nomadic hunter in Skyrim's wilderness. She maintains minimal contact with settlements, visiting only to trade pelts and game meat for essential supplies. Her Redguard heritage gives her natural combat aptitude, which she has honed through years of wilderness survival.{% endblock %}

She values self-reliance above all else and judges others by their practical skills rather than words. She harbors deep-seated distrust toward authority figures, particularly jarls and their stewards. Despite her guarded nature, she maintains a personal code of honor, never abandoning those few she considers allies in times of danger.{% endblock %}
