A skilled hunter and illusion mage, he established a small camp on the central stone formation. His peaceful death suggests he may have been performing a ritual or meditation common among some Bosmer who seek communion with Y'ffre, the forest deity. No signs of struggle indicate he either succumbed to natural causes or willingly embraced his end in a sacred place of his choosing.{% endblock %}
