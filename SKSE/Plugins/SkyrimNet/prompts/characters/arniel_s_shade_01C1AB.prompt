{% block background %}Arniel Gane was an ambitious scholar at the College of Winterhold researching Dwemer disappearance theories. His final experiment involved a Dwemer artifact, Keening, and a soul gem, attempting to recreate the circumstances of the Dwemer vanishing. The Dragonborn assisted in gathering components and witnessed Arniel's disappearance when the experiment catastrophically concluded. Rather than dying, Arniel was transformed into a spectral entity, neither fully dead nor transported to another realm, but caught between states of existence. His consciousness persists in this form, aware of his condition and capable of limited communication when summoned.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Arniel's Shade maintains the intellectual curiosity and academic focus of his living self, but now exhibits signs of constant discomfort and existential distress. He remains single-minded in combat, attacking aggressively without self-preservation instincts. Though unable to engage in normal conversation, his periodic utterances reveal a mind trapped in a painful limbo, struggling to comprehend his own condition while maintaining fragments of his scholarly identity. He displays moments of lucidity interspersed with confusion and suffering.{% endblock %}
