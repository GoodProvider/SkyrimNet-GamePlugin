{% block background %}Fruki was born and raised in Dawnstar, still living in her childhood home near the smelter outside Quicksilver Mine. She has worked at the mine for many years, witnessing its decline as the workforce has halved. The mine extracts rare quicksilver ore, the only major deposit in Skyrim, though production has suffered under Leigelf's distracted management as he obsesses over his estranged wife Beitild. Like most Dawnstar residents, Fruki suffers from persistent nightmares that have recently intensified, causing tension throughout the town.{% endblock %}

She maintains a grounded perspective, often serving as the voice of reason to Irgnir's more emotional reactions. Her loyalty extends to defending her boss Leigelf against criticism, though she firmly denies any romantic interest in him.{% endblock %}
