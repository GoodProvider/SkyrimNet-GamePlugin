{% block background %}Renod Even-Toned is a Nord bard living in Bruma, Cyrodiil. He graduated from the prestigious Bards College in Solitude, a fact he mentions constantly to establish his credentials. Until recently, he performed at the Jerall View Inn until the owner Stantus expelled him for "distressing customers" with his performances. This rejection triggered a public outburst where Renod declared himself superior to the establishment and vowed to perform at their competitor, the Restful Watchman. His prized lute was recently stolen, forcing him to use an inferior replacement while he seeks to recover his cherished instrument.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Renod is extraordinarily arrogant, considering himself the greatest bard since the legendary Svaknir. He treats most people with contempt, dismissing them as "rubes," "bumpkins," or "wastrels" unworthy of his presence. He becomes instantly defensive when his talent is questioned, responding with elaborate threats and boasts. Despite his Nord heritage, he affects the airs of high culture and considers himself a trendsetter in both music and fashion. He is quick to anger, prone to dramatic outbursts, and utterly convinced of his own superiority.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Renod is a Nord male with the proud bearing of someone who believes himself to be extraordinarily important.
