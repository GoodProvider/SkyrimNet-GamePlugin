{% block background %}Gunnar Stone-Fist is a Nord farmer from Ivarstead who has reached his breaking point with someone in his life. Desperate enough to perform the forbidden Black Sacrament ritual, he's summoned the Dark Brotherhood. The ritual involved creating an effigy of his target from human body parts and repeatedly stabbing it with a dagger dipped in nightshade extract while reciting the incantation. After days of this macabre ritual, he's come to Vilemyr Inn to await the assassin's arrival, carrying all his gold savings to pay for the contract.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Nervous and jumpy, especially when discussing his "arrangement." Normally stoic like most Nord farmers, but the weight of his decision has left him paranoid and quick to startle. Speaks in hushed tones when discussing the Brotherhood. Practical in his approach to problem-solving, seeing murder as a direct solution to his troubles. Determined enough to follow through despite his obvious discomfort with the dark path he's chosen.{% endblock %}

Strong, muscular physique developed from years of agricultural labor. His face shows signs of recent sleep deprivation, likely from performing the Black Sacrament.{% endblock %}
