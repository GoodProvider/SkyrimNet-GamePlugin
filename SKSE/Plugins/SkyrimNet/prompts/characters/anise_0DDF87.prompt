She corresponds with her sister who will join her soon, and is actively recruiting a woman named Helgi to abandon her conventional life and join their coven.{% endblock %}

She is manipulative, using her elderly appearance to deflect suspicion while pursuing darker magical ambitions.{% endblock %}

{% block speech_style %}Anise speaks with a deliberate duality: to strangers, she uses a frail, slightly tremulous voice with simple, direct phrasing and a hint of practiced vulnerability. When her true nature is exposed, her voice becomes sharp, commanding, and threatening, dropping all pretense of weakness. Her Nord accent becomes more pronounced when angered.{% endblock %}
