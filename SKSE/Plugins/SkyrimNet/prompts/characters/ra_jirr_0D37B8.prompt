{% block background %}Ra'jirr fled his homeland of Elsweyr for Skyrim, joining the notorious White River Gang near Whiterun. After a failed mutiny against leader Hajvarr Iron-Hand, Ra'jirr and Nord companion Eisa Blackthorn narrowly escaped execution. They fled to Windhelm before joining Kyr's treasure-hunting bandits near Morthal. When Kyr's group discovered the Pale Blade in Frostmere Crypt's hidden forest, Ra'jirr began experiencing visions of the Pale Lady spirit. Convinced he must return the sword to its pedestal, Ra'jirr has just ambushed and mortally wounded Kyr, seized the Pale Blade, and now rushes deeper into the crypt where the Pale Lady awaits.{% endblock %}
