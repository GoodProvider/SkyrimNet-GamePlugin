{% block background %}Bolgeir was appointed housecarl to Elisif after her husband High King Torygg was killed by Ulfric Stormcloak in a traditional Nordic duel. Following this tragedy, Elisif inherited the Jarlship of Haafingar, and Bolgeir's protective role intensified.

His position grants him intimate knowledge of court proceedings and the delicate balance of power between Elisif and General Tullius.{% endblock %}

He disdains the sycophants and political climbers surrounding the Jarl, preferring direct action to courtly intrigue.
