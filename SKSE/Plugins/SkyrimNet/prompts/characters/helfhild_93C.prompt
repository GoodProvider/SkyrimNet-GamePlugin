Their acquisition of this prestigious property marks their ascension into Markarth's upper class. Despite their wealth and status, Helfhild finds herself increasingly concerned about raising her young son Fron in a city plagued by Forsworn insurgency and simmering tensions between Nords and the native Reachmen population. The family employs a Bosmer housekeeper to maintain their large residence, a sign of their prosperity.{% endblock %}
