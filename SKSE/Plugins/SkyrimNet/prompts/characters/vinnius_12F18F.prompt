{% block background %}Born and raised in Cyrodiil, Vinnius established himself as a respected archivist at the Arcane University in the Imperial City. His obsession with the prophecy of the Long Night eventually led him to compile all known lore into a comprehensive book. This work caught the attention of Nelos, a Dunmer mage who leads The Radiant Dark from their headquarters in an abandoned fortress in Haafingar. Though not officially a member, Vinnius now educates the guild's members and manages administrative affairs, finding purpose in supporting those who seek to fulfill the prophecy he's studied his entire life.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Meticulous, dignified, and intellectually proud, Vinnius embodies Imperial scholarly tradition. He values knowledge, order, and precision above all else. Though not fully embracing The Radiant Dark's philosophy that the strong should rule the weak, he respects their ambition and magical prowess. He maintains emotional distance in most interactions, preferring academic discourse to personal connection. His loyalty to knowledge sometimes outweighs moral considerations, justifying his association with a controversial organization through intellectual rationalization.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Vinnius has neatly combed light brown hair and a clean-shaven face that accentuates his Imperial features. His posture is impeccably straight, reflecting his disciplined nature.
