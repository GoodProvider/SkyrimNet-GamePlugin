{% block background %}Trained by both the Dark Brotherhood and College of Winterhold, Donatella cultivated dual expertise in destruction magic and blade work. She maintains her position at the College as perfect cover for her assassination contracts, using academic travel as pretext for her missions. Her Altmer heritage grants her natural magical aptitude, which she has honed to deadly precision, specializing in ice magic that leaves minimal evidence.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Cold, calculating, and intensely private. Donatella speaks only when necessary, observing everything with predatory attention. She values discretion above all else, showing loyalty only to those who maintain her secrets. She approaches problems methodically, preferring elegant solutions that leave no trace. Despite her lethal profession, she adheres to a personal code that prevents her from targeting children or the truly innocent.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Tall and slender with the golden skin and high cheekbones typical of Altmer.

{% block speech_style %}Speaks in precise, measured tones with minimal words. Her Altmer accent emerges only when discussing magic. Uses formal language devoid of contractions or slang.
