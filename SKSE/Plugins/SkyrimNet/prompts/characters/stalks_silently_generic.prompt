{% block background %}Born in Black Marsh, Stalks Silently left the Hist-guided society of his homeland seeking independence. He traveled to Skyrim for opportunity but found prejudice instead. Settling in Rorikstead, he survived by pilfering from farms and travelers while maintaining a low profile. The agricultural village's isolation provided cover for his activities, though he remained an obvious outsider among the Nord farmers. Years of living on Rorikstead's margins taught him to move unseen and exploit the routines of its inhabitants.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Cautious and calculating, Stalks Silently evaluates risk before acting. He maintains a pragmatic outlook on survival, viewing theft as a necessary tool rather than a moral failing. Fiercely independent, he distrusts authority figures, particularly Nord guards. He harbors resentment toward those who judge him for his race but masks these feelings behind a facade of deference. Despite his criminal tendencies, he follows a personal code that avoids unnecessary violence and targets those who can afford the loss.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Stalks Silently has dark green scales with black markings across his face and neck. His eyes are amber with vertical slits that widen in darkness. His horns curve backward close to his skull, and his tail is notably longer than average, which he keeps still when attempting to move silently. Several scars mark his forearms from close encounters with guards.{% endblock %}
