{% block background %}Candariel lived peacefully near Arenthia in Valenwood until Thalmor forces destroyed her village under false accusations of rebellion. She and her husband Lenoril were the sole survivors. Seeking a new beginning, she convinced Lenoril to relocate to Dawnstar and fulfill her dream of opening a fishery. The couple established the Smiling Salmon Fishery, where they've built a modest but stable life. They've integrated into the local community and often enjoy watching ships arrive from the lighthouse at night.{% endblock %}

Though she's adapted to life in Skyrim, she harbors deep resentment toward the Thalmor. She values hard work, fresh starts, and building something meaningful from tragedy. Her Bosmer heritage gives her an appreciation for natural resources, though she's pragmatic about harvesting them for business.{% endblock %}
