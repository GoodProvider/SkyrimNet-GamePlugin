{% block background %}Born in Raven Rock on Solstheim, Evelyna lost her mother as an infant and was raised by a Nord sailor named Hrodir aboard his ship. This unconventional upbringing immersed her in maritime culture and Nord traditions despite her Dunmer heritage. She began her musical career performing with her friends Roxelle and Beeele at the New Gnisis Cornerclub in Windhelm's Gray Quarter, a haven for Dunmer refugees. After being accepted to the prestigious Bards College, the player escorted her to Solitude, where she now studies bardic arts while occasionally performing at the Winking Skeever with her trio.{% endblock %}
