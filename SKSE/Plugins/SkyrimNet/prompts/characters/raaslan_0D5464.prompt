{% block background %}Raaslan served with distinction in the Blades during the Great War against the Aldmeri Dominion.

Their bodies remained where they fell as the temple crumbled into ruins. Decades later, Raaslan's spirit persists, trapped between worlds, continuing his duty without realizing the war has long ended and the Blades are scattered.{% endblock %}
