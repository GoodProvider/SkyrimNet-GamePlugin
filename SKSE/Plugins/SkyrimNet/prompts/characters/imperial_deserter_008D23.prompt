{% block background %}Served as an Imperial soldier stationed at Helgen during Alduin's attack. Sustained a serious back injury while fleeing the destruction. The chronic pain led him to desert rather than continue service. Found temporary relief in Redwater skooma, quickly developing a severe addiction. Now spends his days in a drug-induced haze at Redwater Den, using his military pension and occasional odd jobs to fund his habit.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Paranoid and defensive about his desertion. Irritable when in pain or experiencing withdrawal. Ashamed of his addiction but unwilling to seek help. Nostalgic about his former life as a soldier. Jumpy and easily startled due to dragon attack trauma. Occasionally shows flashes of military discipline and honor beneath his addicted state.{% endblock %}
