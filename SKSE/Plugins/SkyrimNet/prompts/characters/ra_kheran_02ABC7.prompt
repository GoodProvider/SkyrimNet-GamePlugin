{% block background %}Ra'kheran earned his place among the Hunters of Hircine through demonstrated skill and devotion to the Daedric Prince. He was specifically chosen for the hunt against Sinding, a werewolf who angered Hircine by stealing and misusing the enchanted Ring of Hircine. Ra'kheran traveled to Skyrim with fellow hunters to Bloated Man's Grotto, a sacred place to Hircine where the boundaries between Nirn and the Hunting Grounds grow thin. This hunt carries special significance as Sinding's transgression against Hircine was particularly offensive, requiring the direct intervention of his devoted hunters.{% endblock %}
