{% block background %}Born the "Diamond of Riverwood," Zora was blessed with beauty and charm while her sister Joselyn lived in her shadow. After a sibling quarrel, Joselyn permanently scarred Zora's face with a fire-imbued slap.

She's been captured by necromancers multiple times but always rejected as a subject due to her scarred face.{% endblock %}
