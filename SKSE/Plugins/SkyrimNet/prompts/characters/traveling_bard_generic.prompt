{% block background %}Originally recruited by Isran when the Dawnguard was reformed, this agent was selected for undercover work due to basic musical knowledge and an unassuming demeanor. Travels established trade routes between major holds, staying at inns where travelers share information. Reports vampire activity back to Fort Dawnguard through coded messages left at predetermined drop points. Has witnessed firsthand the devastation caused by vampire attacks on small settlements, fueling personal commitment to the Dawnguard cause.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Vigilant and observant, constantly assessing surroundings for threats. Maintains a friendly, approachable facade while harboring deep suspicion of strangers. Deflects personal questions with practiced ease. Demonstrates unwavering loyalty to the Dawnguard and Isran's mission. Pragmatic about survival, willing to flee rather than fight when outnumbered. Deeply distrusts court mages and anyone showing unusual interest in blood or necromancy.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Average height with alert, scanning eyes that miss little. Complexion weathered from travel but healthy, deliberately contrasting with the pallor of vampires.
