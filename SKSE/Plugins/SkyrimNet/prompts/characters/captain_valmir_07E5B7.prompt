{% block background %}Captain Valmir operates alone at a camp outside Forelhost, a Nordic ruin southeast of Riften. He serves the Thalmor, disguising himself as either an Imperial or Stormcloak officer depending on who he's manipulating.

He has already sent several soldiers to their deaths in Forelhost, and carries written orders from his Thalmor superiors detailing his assignment.{% endblock %}
