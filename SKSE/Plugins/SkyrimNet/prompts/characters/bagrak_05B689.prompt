{% block background %}Born in Mor Khazgur to Sharamph, the stronghold's wise woman, Bagrak followed Orcish tradition by becoming the first wife of Chief Larak, who is also her brother. This arrangement, while unusual to outsiders, aligns with Malacath's teachings that Orcs can safely practice consanguineous marriage. Bagrak has borne one daughter, Borgakh the Steel Heart, who has reached marriageable age and will soon be sent to another stronghold as part of the traditional exchange that maintains Orcish bloodlines and alliances. Bagrak serves as a warrior-protector of Mor Khazgur, patrolling its watchtowers and maintaining vigilance against threats from the harsh Reach wilderness.{% endblock %}

She adheres strictly to Malacath's Code of Blood, believing in honor through strength and sacrifice.{% endblock %}
