{% block background %}Ennodius worked as a lumberjack at Anga's Mill under Aeri's supervision until his paranoia became unmanageable. He abruptly abandoned his position and established a small camp west of the mill beside a waterfall on the River Yorgrim. His paranoia stems from a genuine threat - he is targeted by the Dark Brotherhood, though he doesn't know who placed the contract. He now lives as a hermit, constantly vigilant and suspicious of all visitors.{% endblock %}
