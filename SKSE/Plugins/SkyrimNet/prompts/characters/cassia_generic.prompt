{% block background %}Born to Redguard sailors, Cassia grew up traveling Tamriel's coasts before settling in Dawnstar. The harsh beauty of The Pale captivated her, leading her to abandon seafaring for the life of a ranger. She now serves as an unofficial protector of Dawnstar's perimeter, hunting game for the settlement while eliminating threats from wildlife and bandits. Years in the wilderness have left her more comfortable with animals than people, whose destructive tendencies toward nature she has witnessed firsthand throughout Skyrim.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Stoic and contemplative, Cassia values directness and honesty above social niceties. She harbors deep resentment toward those who exploit nature and holds little faith in political solutions. Her emotional responses are measured but intense when triggered by environmental destruction or cruelty. She maintains a pragmatic outlook on survival while nursing idealistic hopes for wilderness preservation. Her trust is difficult to earn but unwavering once given.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Cassia has dark copper skin weathered by constant exposure to Skyrim's harsh elements. Her black hair is tightly braided against her scalp to prevent interference with archery.

{% block speech_style %}Speaks in clipped, economical sentences that deliver maximum meaning with minimum words. Her tone is low and measured, with a subtle Hammerfell accent that emerges more strongly when emotional. Pauses frequently to choose precise words rather than speaking impulsively. Delivers observations with unflinching directness, eschewing metaphor for clarity except when discussing nature, where her language becomes more poetic and reverent.{% endblock %}
