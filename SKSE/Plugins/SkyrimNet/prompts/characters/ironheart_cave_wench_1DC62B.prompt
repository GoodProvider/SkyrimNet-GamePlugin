{% block background %}Born in Hammerfell but migrated to Skyrim seeking opportunity, she found work at Ironheart Cave after struggling to find legitimate employment. The remote location between Haafingar and the Reach provides both protection from authorities and access to travelers from multiple holds.

She has adapted to the harsh realities of tavern life, learning to handle difficult patrons while maintaining her dignity despite the compromising nature of her work.{% endblock %}

Fiercely protective of her earnings and personal boundaries. Displays Redguard pride despite her circumstances. Calculated in her interactions, always weighing potential profit against personal risk. Harbors resentment toward her situation but channels it into determination rather than despair.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Tanned Redguard skin with amber-hazel eyes that catch the tavern's dim light. Dark hair styled to frame her pretty face. Athletic build typical of Redguard women, with natural grace in her movements.
