{% block background %}Born to a once-prominent Nord family with ties to trade between Skyrim and the Summerset Isles, Vartheim grew up hearing tales of his ancestor who acquired a finely crafted elven sword during the Second Era. The heirloom was lost generations ago, possibly during a bandit raid. Family records suggest it may be hidden in an ancient Nordic ruin. Vartheim has invested considerable resources tracking its location, hiring Benild for her expertise in elven artifacts. His rivalry with Pelgurt has intensified since discovering his nephew is independently searching for the same sword.{% endblock %}
