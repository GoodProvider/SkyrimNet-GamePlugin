{% block background %}Born to Jarl Balgruuf the Greater, Frothar was raised in Dragonsreach, the ancient palace of Whiterun. As the eldest son, he has been groomed from birth to eventually succeed his father as Jarl. His mother is notably absent, with no mention of her in Whiterun, suggesting she either died or left the family. Unlike his half-brother Nelkir, who is known for his dark moods and rude comments, and his sister Dagny, who behaves imperiously, Frothar demonstrates a more mature and respectful demeanor that reflects his upbringing as the heir apparent.{% endblock %}

Despite his young age, he demonstrates patience and observance, often watching court proceedings to learn from his father's example.{% endblock %}
