He escaped through Bruma Caverns with help from a man named Botram, who provided a hidden trap door escape route. Crecius fled with Aera to establish the Camp of the Devout in the eastern wilderness of County Bruma, where they maintain a small shrine and community of Talos worshippers in defiance of the White-Gold Concordat.{% endblock %}
