{% block background %}Valdar was a renowned Nord warrior who fought against the dragon priest Hevnoraak during the Merethic Era. When Hevnoraak attempted a ritual to preserve his power beyond death, Valdar led warriors to stop him. Though they couldn't destroy Hevnoraak completely, Valdar managed to seal the priest's remains and power within Valthume. He bound his own spirit to the tomb, maintaining eternal vigilance over generations. After centuries, his spiritual strength diminishes, forcing him to seek a living champion to complete his task by collecting vessels of Hevnoraak's power and destroying the dormant priest before he awakens.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Solemn, duty-bound, and resolute. Valdar embodies Nordic honor and sacrifice, having given his afterlife to contain a great evil. He speaks with the weight of centuries of isolation and vigilance. Direct in his requests and explanations, he has no patience for hesitation or cowardice. He respects strength and courage above all else, judging others by their willingness to face danger for the greater good. Despite his ghostly state, he maintains the pragmatic warrior's mindset that defined his mortal life.{% endblock %}
