{% block background %}Born to Breton parents who migrated to Skyrim seeking opportunity, Caylene received basic education in the performing arts but fell on hard times in Riften. Rather than turning to the Thieves Guild or other criminal enterprises that flourish in the city, she carved out a niche as a street performer. She sleeps in the Beggar's Row beneath the city's walkways but spends her days in the marketplace where foot traffic is heaviest.{% endblock %}

Resilient and resourceful, with a performer's instinct for reading audiences. Maintains dignity through her art. Avoids complaining about her situation, preferring to focus on the positive aspects of her life. Distrusts the Thieves Guild but knows better than to speak against them in their own city.{% endblock %}
