{% block background %}Born to a Khajiit trading caravan, Qa'Dojo abandoned mercantile pursuits after a spiritual awakening during a pilgrimage to Elsweyr's Temple of the Two Moons Dance. He traveled extensively through Tamriel, studying with various religious orders before developing his own philosophy of cosmic balance. He settled in Skyrim during the civil war, seeing it as a place where balance between opposing forces was desperately needed.{% endblock %}
