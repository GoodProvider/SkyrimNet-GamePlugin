{% block background %}Born to Gerdur and Hod, the owners of Riverwood's sawmill, Frodnar comes from a family with deep roots in the settlement. His mother's ancestors founded Riverwood generations ago, giving his family significant standing in the community. His uncle Ralof serves as a Stormcloak soldier, influencing Frodnar's political views despite his young age. He spends his days playing with his dog Stump and his best friend Dorthe, the blacksmith's daughter, often planning elaborate pranks on townspeople.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Frodnar is rebellious, mischievous, and proud. He revels in planning and executing pranks, showing little remorse when others find them mean-spirited. He resents the expectation that he'll eventually work at the family mill, viewing it as a form of servitude. Despite his troublemaking nature, he shows loyalty to his family and their Stormcloak allegiance. He maintains a tough exterior, particularly with strangers, but is capable of genuine friendship as shown by his bond with Dorthe despite their families' opposing political views.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Frodnar is a young Nord boy with blond hair like his parents. He has the sturdy build typical of Nord children, though still clearly a child in his features and stature.
