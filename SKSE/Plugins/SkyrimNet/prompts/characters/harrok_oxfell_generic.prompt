{% block background %}Born in The Reach, a harsh mountainous region known for its unforgiving terrain and Forsworn conflicts, Harrok Oxfell developed into a formidable warrior. His upbringing among the jagged peaks instilled both physical strength and a deep-seated fear of heights. Rather than allowing this fear to limit him, Harrok confronted it directly by leaping from the Druadach Mountains, a defining moment that transformed his outlook. He now travels Skyrim seeking worthy opponents to test his mettle.{% endblock %}

Having conquered his own fear, he has little patience for those who succumb to theirs.{% endblock %}
