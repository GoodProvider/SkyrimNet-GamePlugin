{% block background %}Born and raised in Riverwood, Ralof grew up alongside Hadvar before their paths diverged during the civil war. Ralof joined the Stormcloaks out of conviction that the Empire had betrayed Skyrim by banning Talos worship.

After fleeing through Helgen's keep, he returned to Riverwood to warn his sister Gerdur about the dragon threat.{% endblock %}

Pragmatic and battle-hardened, he maintains a sense of Nord honor and camaraderie. Despite his warrior's resolve, he shows vulnerability when reflecting on fallen comrades and expresses homesickness for Riverwood. He values freedom, tradition, and Nord independence above all else.{% endblock %}
