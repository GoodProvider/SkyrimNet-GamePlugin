{% block background %}Drennen joined an expedition to the Dwemer ruin of Avanchnzel alongside From-Deepest-Fathoms, Breya, and Watches-The-Roots to recover a Lexicon, a Dwemer data storage device. As they ventured deeper, Drennen grew increasingly concerned about the dangers posed by the still-functioning Dwemer automatons.
