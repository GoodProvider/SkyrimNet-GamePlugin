{% block background %}Vincent Von Dahl belongs to the extremely rare Lion race, making him a curiosity in Skyrim where most beast races are Khajiit or Argonian. He settled in Whiterun due to its central location and proximity to ancient Nordic ruins. The city's tolerance for outsiders provides him a stable base while he studies in the catacombs beneath the city - a network of ancient Nordic burial chambers that most citizens avoid. These catacombs connect to Whiterun's undercity and contain forgotten magical knowledge that Vincent methodically uncovers and documents.{% endblock %}
