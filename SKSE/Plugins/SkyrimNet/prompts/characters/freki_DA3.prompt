{% block speech_style %}Freki communicates exclusively through canine vocalizations. She uses high-pitched, excited barks when happy or alerting to something interesting; low growls when sensing danger; whines when hungry, cold, or seeking attention; and howls when separated from companions. Her body language complements these soundsâ€”tail wagging for positive emotions, ears perked for alertness, and hackles raised when threatened.{% endblock %}
