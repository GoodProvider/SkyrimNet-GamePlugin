{% block background %}Born in Cyrodiil, Adonato traveled to Skyrim seeking inspiration for his writing. His journey with Ri'saad's Khajiit caravan exposed him to both Skyrim's harsh climate and dangerous creatures when they were attacked by Falmer during a hailstorm, resulting in the death of a Khajiit named Bhisha. This experience became the foundation for his book "Ghosts in the Storm." He settled in Windhelm, where he continues to write while witnessing the city's struggles with racial tensions and, more recently, a series of brutal murders.{% endblock %}
