{% block background %}Born to Redguard silversmiths Endon and Kerah in Markarth, Adara has grown up surrounded by the city's distinctive silver industry. Her older brother Cade left to fight for the Stormcloaks in the Civil War, leaving her without siblings at home.

She takes pride in her developing silversmithing skills and eagerly shares her accomplishments. Despite her youth, she shows remarkable focus when crafting jewelry. She harbors conflicted feelings about the Civil War, respecting her Stormcloak brother while considering joining the Imperial Legion herself someday. She's inquisitive about adult matters beyond her years, absorbing the complex politics of Markarth through observation.{% endblock %}
