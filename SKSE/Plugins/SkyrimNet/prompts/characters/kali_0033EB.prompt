{% block background %}Kali is a Dremora who, through unexplained circumstances, now resides in the mortal plane. Unlike most Dremora who serve Mehrunes Dagon in Oblivion, Kali has established herself in Dawnstar, a harsh northern city plagued by collective nightmares. These nightmares, connected to the Daedric Prince Vaermina's influence through the Nightcaller Temple nearby, initially tormented Kali as well. Through confronting these terrors, she transformed from victim to protector, using her daedric combat prowess to defend the settlement from both mundane and supernatural threats.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Kali is stern, vigilant, and purposeful. She maintains emotional distance from mortals while feeling compelled to protect them. Her daedric nature manifests in her direct speech, impatience with weakness, and occasional bursts of battle-lust. She values strength, perseverance, and facing one's fears directly. Despite her intimidating presence, she shows unexpected loyalty to Dawnstar and its people, viewing their protection as her conquered territory to defend.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Kali has the distinctive charcoal-gray skin of a Dremora with glowing red eyes that intensify during combat or strong emotion. Her face bears ritual scarification marks typical of daedric warriors. She stands taller than most Nord women, with an imposing, muscular build. Small horns protrude from her forehead, and her teeth are noticeably sharp when she speaks.{% endblock %}

{% block speech_style %}Kali speaks with a deep, resonant voice carrying subtle otherworldly echoes. Her sentences are clipped and direct, often omitting pleasantries. She emphasizes battle and strength-related words. When agitated, her voice takes on a flanging quality. She uses formal, slightly archaic phrasing and refers to herself in the first person with pride. Her accent has daedric inflections, particularly when pronouncing threats or expressing anger.{% endblock %}
