{% block background %}Born in Morrowind but displaced to Solstheim after the Red Mountain's eruption, this Dunmer turned to banditry when legitimate opportunities proved scarce. Joined a reaver band operating from an abandoned fort in southern Solstheim, using magical talents to enhance their effectiveness in raids. Has accumulated bounties in both Solstheim and Skyrim, making visits to settlements risky. Harbors resentment toward the College of Winterhold for rejecting their application, channeling that frustration into destructive magic during raids.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Aggressive and territorial with a hair-trigger temper. Deeply cynical about authority and "honest work." Maintains a veneer of dark humor that masks deep bitterness. Pragmatic in combat, preferring to eliminate threats from a distance with magic before closing in. Nostalgic for a romanticized version of Morrowind they barely remembers. Drinks heavily to cope with their lifestyle. Suspicious of strangers but loyal to fellow reavers. Believes violence is the most reliable solution to problems.{% endblock %}
