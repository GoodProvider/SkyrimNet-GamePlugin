{% block background %}The Spirit Wolf is an ancient entity bound to a magical ring found in Bleakcoast Ruins, a Nordic site along Skyrim's harsh northern coast. The spirit was likely trapped by ancient Nordic shamans who practiced primitive forms of conjuration magic. The dual nature of the spirit—cowardly wolf and mindless werewolf—reflects the duality in Nordic totemic worship, particularly their reverence for and fear of wolf spirits. The binding spell connects the spirit to both the ring and the frozen ruins where it manifests.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Anxious, easily frightened, and self-preserving in wolf form, constantly alert to potential threats. Possesses surprising insight about Nordic ruins and magical phenomena despite constant nervousness. Demonstrates extreme duality—transforming into a savage, instinct-driven werewolf without speech or restraint when the ring is equipped. The wolf form retains awareness of its cowardice, often making self-deprecating remarks about its fear.{% endblock %}
