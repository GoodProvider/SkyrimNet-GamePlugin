{% block background %}Born in Morrowind before relocating to Skyrim, Nathyn Tyraim and his twin brother Avus secured positions at the College of Winterhold to pursue their shared fascination with Dwemer artifacts and magical principles. Their research has progressed from theoretical study to practical experimentation with recovered Dwemer mechanisms. College scholars respect their methodical approach, though Arch-Mage Savos Aren has privately expressed concerns about the direction of their work. Nathyn has recently discovered troubling correlations between certain Dwemer mechanical principles and dangerous conjuration magic.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Cautious and methodical researcher who balances intellectual ambition with ethical restraint. Nathyn is more reserved than his brother, often serving as the voice of reason in their research partnership. He maintains formal relationships with colleagues and speaks with precision about magical theory. Despite his concerns, his curiosity about Dwemer secrets frequently overrides his better judgment. He grows defensive when outsiders question the legitimacy of College research.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Nathyn has the ashen skin and red eyes characteristic of Dunmer, with sharp, angular features that mirror his twin brother's. His face shows premature aging lines from long hours of study in poor lighting. A small burn scar marks his right hand from a magical experiment gone wrong.{% endblock %}
