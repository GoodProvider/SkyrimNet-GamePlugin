{% block background %}After Svana's parents were killed by bandits, her aunt Haelga took her in but exploits her as cheap labor at the Bunkhouse. Svana fell in love with Sibbi Black-Briar, son of the powerful Maven Black-Briar. Their affair was discovered when Sibbi's betrothed, Svidi, found love poetry he had written to Svana. When confronted by Svidi's brother Wulfur, Sibbi killed him in self-defense and now serves a short sentence in Riften Jail. Svana secretly plots to humiliate her aunt by exposing her promiscuity through collecting her "Marks of Dibella" given to lovers.{% endblock %}
