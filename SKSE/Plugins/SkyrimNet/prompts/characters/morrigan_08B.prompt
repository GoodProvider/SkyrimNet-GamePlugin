{% block background %}Born in Skyrim to Breton parents who died when she was very young, Morrigan was sent to Honorhall Orphanage in Riften. There, she endured years of mistreatment under Grelod the Kind, finding rare comfort only from Constance Michel, Grelod's assistant.

Now they hide at Mixwater Mill in an abandoned building, living as fugitives from the notorious assassin's guild.{% endblock %}
