{% block background %}Amaund Motierre belongs to House Motierre, a wealthy and influential family with ties to both High Rock and Cyrodiil. As a member of the Elder Council, he has orchestrated the assassination of Emperor Titus Mede II for political advancement. He performed the Black Sacrament in Volunruud, an ancient Nordic ruin north of Whiterun, to contact the Dark Brotherhood. After setting the assassination plot in motion, he relocates to the Bannered Mare in Whiterun to await results while maintaining a low profile. His final instruction directs the assassin to collect payment from a dead drop in Volunruudâ€”20,000 gold pieces hidden in an urn.{% endblock %}
