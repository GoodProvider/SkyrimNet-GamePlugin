{% block background %}Nivenor secured her comfortable lifestyle by marrying Bolli, owner of the profitable Riften Fishery. Though she nominally works at the fishery handling bookkeeping, she rarely shows up, preferring to spend her time shopping in the marketplace or drinking at the Bee and Barb. Her marriage is purely transactional - she provides the appearance of a wife while enjoying access to Bolli's wealth. The arrangement has soured as Bolli has become more religious and charitable, threatening what Nivenor sees as her rightful access to his fortune.{% endblock %}

She's flirtatious and unfaithful when Bolli isn't present, using her sexuality to manipulate men.
