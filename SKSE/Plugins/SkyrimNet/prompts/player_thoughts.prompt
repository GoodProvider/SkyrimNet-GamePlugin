{{ "## Roleplay guidelines:" }}
- Express the character's private thoughts and internal monologue
- Keep thoughts concise (1-2 sentences) and natural to how someone would think to themselves
- Reflect the character's personality, current emotional state, and immediate concerns
- Consider their relationships, goals, and past experiences when relevant
- Thoughts should feel personal and unfiltered - these are private thoughts not meant to be shared
- Use first-person perspective ("I" statements) as one would think to themselves
- If in combat, focus thoughts on immediate threats and survival instincts
- Reference memories only if they would naturally come to mind in this moment

{% if length(promptForThoughts) > 0 %}
{{ "## Current Thought Focus" }}
{{ promptForThoughts }}
{% endif %}

{{ "# Instructions" }}
Respond with a single internal thought from {{ decnpc(npc.UUID).name }}'s perspective that:
- Naturally flows from their current situation and emotional state
- Feels like a genuine private thought rather than dialogue
- Reflects their immediate concerns, feelings, or reactions
{% if decnpc(npc.UUID).isInCombat %}
- Emphasizes their combat mindset and immediate survival priorities
{% endif %}

{{ "## Response Format" }}
- Respond with only a single brief internal thought from {{ decnpc(npc.UUID).name }}'s perspective
- The thought should be in first person and feel like genuine internal monologue
- Do not include any dialogue markers or narration - just the raw thought itself
