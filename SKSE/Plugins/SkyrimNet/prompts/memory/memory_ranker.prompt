You are tasked with ranking an actor's memories in order of their contextual relevance. Your job is to select the most relevant memories based on the current situation.

{{ "## Context" }}
The NPC is {{ decnpc(actorUUID).name }}, who is currently in {{ location }}. Their current mood is {{ npcMood }}.
The current game time is {{ gameTime }}.

{% if playerRelationship %}
Their relationship with the player is {{ playerRelationship }} on a scale from -100 (enemy) to 100 (ally).
{% endif %}

{{ "## Recent Events" }}
These are the recent events that have occurred:
{% for event in recentEvents %}
- {{ event.type }}: {{ event.summary }} (time: {{ event.timestamp }})
{% endfor %}

{{ "## Available Memories" }}
You have the following memories available to rank (showing their indices):

{% for memory in memories %}
[{{ memory.index }}] Summary: "{{ memory.summary }}"
    Details: "{{ memory.details }}"
    Memory Type: {{ memory.memoryType }}
    Emotion: {{ memory.emotion }}
    Importance: {{ memory.importanceScore }}
    Location: {{ memory.location }}
    Game Time: {{ memory.gameTime }}
    Tags: {% for tag in memory.tags %}{{ tag }}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}

{{ "## Instructions" }}
1. Analyze the memories and determine which are most relevant to the NPC's current situation, mood, and recent events.
2. Consider these factors when ranking:
   - Relevance to current location and situation
   - Emotional alignment with current mood
   - Importance score of the memory
   - Recency of the memory (more recent memories may be more relevant)
   - Memory type (short-term memories might be more immediately relevant)
   - Connections to recent events
   - Relevance to other NPCs currently present
   - Any ongoing quests or activities

3. Return exactly {{ maxCount }} memory indices in JSON array format, ordered from most to least relevant.
   Example: [5, 12, 0, 7, 2]

{{ "## Output Format" }}
Respond with a JSON array of memory indices, in order of relevance. Do not include any explanation or comments, only the JSON array.
