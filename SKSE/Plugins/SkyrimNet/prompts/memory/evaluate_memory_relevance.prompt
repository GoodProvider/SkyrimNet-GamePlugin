{{ "# TASK" }}
Evaluate which of the above events would be relevant to form memories for this NPC based on:
1. The NPC's current context (location, mood, nearby NPCs)
2. Events that directly involve the NPC (as originator or target)
3. Significant events the NPC may have witnessed
4. Events that would reasonably impact the NPC's knowledge or emotional state

{{ "# OUTPUT FORMAT" }}
Return a JSON object with the following structure:
```json
{
  "relevantEvents": [
    {
      "eventIndex": <number>,
      "relevanceReason": "<brief explanation>",
      "emotionalImpact": "<emotion tag>",
      "importanceScore": <number 0-10>
    },
    // Additional relevant events...
  ]
}
```

Emotional impact should be one of: {{ join(moodsList, ", ") }}
Importance score should be between 0-10, with 10 being extremely important to the NPC.
