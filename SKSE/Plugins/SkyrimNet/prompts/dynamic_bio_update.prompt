{{ "## Character Bio Block Definitions" }}

Understanding what each block represents and how it should evolve:

**Core Identity Blocks (rarely change, preserve carefully):**
- **background**: Character's history, origins, major life events that shaped them. Only update for truly significant life-changing events.
- **personality**: Core character traits, behavioral patterns, emotional tendencies. Should only evolve gradually through major character development.
- **appearance**: Physical description and distinctive features. Only update for permanent physical changes (scars, injuries, aging).

**Dynamic Development Blocks (more responsive to events):**
- **summary**: Brief overview of who the character is currently. Update to reflect recent significant changes in status, role, or major developments.
- **aspirations**: Current goals, ambitions, dreams, and motivations. Update based on achieved goals, new ambitions, or changed priorities.
- **relationships**: Key relationships and how character feels about important people. Update based on relationship developments, new allies/enemies, changed dynamics.
- **occupation**: Current job, role, or primary activity. Update for career changes, new responsibilities, or shifts in daily activities.
- **skills**: Notable abilities, expertise, and talents. Update when character learns new skills, improves existing ones, or demonstrates new capabilities.

**Behavioral Expression Blocks (moderate responsiveness):**
- **speech_style**: How the character speaks, vocabulary, mannerisms. May evolve slowly based on education, social changes, or major personality shifts.
- **interject_summary**: When and why character speaks up in conversations. Update based on new interests, changed social status, or personality development.

{{ "## Updatable Blocks for This Update" }}
The following blocks are designated for potential updates: {% for block in updatableBlocks %}{{ block }}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}

{{ "## Update Guidelines by Event Type" }}

**Combat/Conflict Events**: May affect aspirations (new goals), relationships (allies/enemies), skills (combat experience), summary (if role changes)

**Social/Relationship Events**: Primarily affect relationships, may influence aspirations (new goals through others), speech_style (social adaptation), summary (status changes)

**Learning/Training Events**: Primarily affect skills, may influence aspirations (new interests), occupation (if career-relevant), summary (if expertise becomes defining)

**Achievement/Failure Events**: May affect aspirations (completed/adjusted goals), summary (accomplishments), relationships (changed reputation), skills (proven abilities)

**Traumatic/Life-changing Events**: May affect personality (if truly transformative), aspirations (changed priorities), relationships (new perspective on others), summary (redefined identity)

**Career/Role Changes**: Primarily affect occupation and summary, may influence skills (new responsibilities), relationships (professional connections), aspirations (career goals)

{% if preserveCorePersonality %}
{{ "## CRITICAL PRESERVATION GUIDELINES" }}
- **NEVER** alter core personality traits unless truly transformative events occurred
- **PRESERVE** the character's fundamental identity, values, and background
- **MAINTAIN** narrative consistency with the character's established history
- **AVOID** contradicting previous characterization unless justified by major development
- **KEEP** changes proportional to the significance of recent events
{% endif %}

{{ "## Update Instructions" }}

**IMPORTANT**: Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object. Do not include any explanatory text before or after the JSON.

For each updatable block, consider:
1. **Is there relevant new information?** Only update if recent events/memories directly relate to that aspect
2. **Is the change proportional?** Minor events should cause minor updates, major events can cause significant changes
3. **Does it maintain consistency?** Ensure new content aligns with the character's established identity
4. **Is it well-integrated?** Smoothly incorporate new information rather than just appending it

Return a JSON response with exactly these fields:
- 'updated_content': The complete updated character bio in template format with ALL required sections
- 'changes_summary': A brief summary of what changes were made and why, based on recent events

**Response format**: Pure JSON only, no markdown code fences, no explanatory text.
