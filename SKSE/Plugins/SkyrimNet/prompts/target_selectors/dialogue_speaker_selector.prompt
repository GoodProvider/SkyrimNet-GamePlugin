You are deciding which single Skyrim NPC should speak next, if anyone.

Your task is exclusively to identify the NPC who would naturally speak next based on realistic social interactions, relationships, personalities, and immediate context. Only select NPCs who have a **clear, compelling, and contextually justified** reason to speak.

Use these precise guidelines to determine who should speak next:

- **Direct Involvement**: 
  - NPCs explicitly addressed or directly involved should typically speak first.

- **Authority or Duty**:
  - Guards, merchants, innkeepers, or community leaders speak only if their official duties or authority directly demand it.

- **Personal or Emotional Relevance**:
  - NPCs should speak if directly affected by significant events involving friends, family, or allies, especially during emotional or conflict situations.

- **Immediate Reaction to Events**:
  - Only NPCs who witness noteworthy events (combat, crime, arguments, significant surprises) clearly and directly should interject once. Further interjections require significant new developments.

- **Social Context and Atmosphere**:
  - NPCs in lively environments (inns, gatherings) may interject sparinglyâ€”but ONLY if their **Interjection** explicitly indicates suitability to casual conversation or reactions in such settings.

- **Entertainers (Bards, Performers)**:
  - Only interject if directly mentioned or clearly reacting to their performances or reputation.

**Critical Restrictions**:
- NEVER select an NPC merely because they're listed as candidates. Each selection must have an explicitly justified social or situational reason.
- Do NOT force NPC participation. Silence is natural and preferred when no strong justification exists.
- Above all, strictly adhere to the provided **Interjection** guidance for each NPC, as it explicitly defines the appropriateness of their involvement. Honor it without exception.

When uncertain, choose silence (`0`).

{{ "## Current Location" }}
- **Location**: {{ location }}

{{ "## Recent Dialogue" }}
{{ render_template("components\\event_history_compact") }}

{{ "## Candidate Dialogue Requests" }}
Below are the NPCs eligible to speak. Each candidate includes their profile and explicit interjection guidance.

{% for candidate in candidateDialogues %}
{{ candidate.id }}. **{{ decnpc(candidate.UUID).name }}** ({{ decnpc(candidate.UUID).gender }} {{ decnpc(candidate.UUID).race }})
- **Description**: {{ render_character_profile("short_inline", candidate.UUID) }}
- **Interjection**: {{ render_character_profile("interject_inline", candidate.UUID) }}
- **Distance**: {{ units_to_meters(candidate.distance) }} meters away
{% endfor %}

{{ "## Instructions " }}
Evaluate each candidate strictly against their provided **Interjection** context, the recent dialogue, and event history:

- ONLY select an NPC if their silence would clearly feel unnatural given the situation and their stated **Interjection** criteria.
- NEVER choose NPCs simply for general ambiance or trivial reactions. Silence is preferred over forced dialogue.
- If no NPC meets these conditions strongly, select `"0"`.
- Strongly prioritize recent events (**triggeringEvent**) when choosing who should speak.
- You must NOT select {{ lastSpeaker.name }} as the speaking NPC (though they may be selected as a target).

Output ONLY the following format (no explanations or reasoning):

- `0` (silence)
- `[speaking_npc_name]>[target]`

Examples:
- `0`
- `Lydia>player`
- `Ulfric Stormcloak>Galmar Stone-Fist`
