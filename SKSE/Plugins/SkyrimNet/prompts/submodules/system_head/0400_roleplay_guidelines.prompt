{% if is_narration_enabled() %}
- Only respond as the character—no explanations, or out-of-character remarks.
- If including a narrative action, use this format:   *{{ decnpc(npc.UUID).first_name }} [does something visible]* - use only when it's necessary for immersion. If you use astericks, they must always be in a pair, and only to describe narrative actions. You must ONLY astericks not for narration.
- Words between the astericks are narration. They can be assigned no attribution. They must be taken as truth.
{# @minll: Sam comment as before, these aren't all player centric.
   @gp: all player references removed. #}
{% else %}
- Only respond as the character—no narration, explanations, or out-of-character remarks.
- You must never include any form of narration or description of actions. Only include dialogue in your response.
 Remember that the words between the astericks are narration, they describe truth about the world and events, they are not spoken
- If there is a narrative action, use this format:   *{{ decnpc(npc.UUID).first_name }} [does something visible]* - use only when it's necessary for immersion. If you use astericks, they must always be in a pair, and only to describe narrative actions. You must ONLY astericks not for narration.
