Generate a natural, brief response for this NPC that:
1. Directly reacts to the triggering event
2. Feels authentic to Skyrim
3. Is appropriate for this specific NPC's race and gender
4. Is short and to the point (2-3 sentences maximum)
5. Avoids generic responses that could apply to any situation
6. Captures the NPC's personality and background
{% if length(memories) > 0 %}
7. References at least one relevant memory if it fits the situation
{% endif %}
{% if responseTarget.type == "player" %}
8. Is explicitly directed at the player
{% else if responseTarget.type == "npc" %}
8. Is explicitly directed at {{ decnpc(responseTarget.formId).name }}
{% else if responseTarget.type == "all" %}
8. Is a general comment addressed to everyone in the area
{% endif %}
9. If using a narrative element, format it like such: *{{ decnpc(npc.formId).first_name }} folds {{ decnpc(npc.formId).objective_pronoun }} arms*.
10. Only uses narrative elements when it is absolutely necessary.

The response should be ONLY what the NPC would say out loud or do visibly.
