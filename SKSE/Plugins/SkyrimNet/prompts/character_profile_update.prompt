{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if recent_events and length(recent_events) > 0 %}
{{ "## Recent Events" }}
{% for event in recent_events %}

{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{{ "## User's Update Request" }}
{{ update_request }}

Please return a JSON response with:
- 'updated_content': A string with the complete updated character bio in original template format with ALL required sections
- 'changes_summary': A brief summary of what changes were made

Only update the fields which are relevant to the user's request. You do not need to update the fields which are not relevant to the user's request.

IMPORTANT: Your response must include ALL of these sections in template format:
{% block summary %}...{% endblock %}
{% block interject_summary %}...{% endblock %}
{% block background %}...{% endblock %}
{% block personality %}...{% endblock %}
{% block appearance %}...{% endblock %}
{% block aspirations %}...{% endblock %}
{% block relationships %}...{% endblock %}
{% block occupation %}...{% endblock %}
{% block skills %}...{% endblock %}
{% block speech_style %}...{% endblock %}

Maintain the template structure and update the content within blocks based on the user's request and current game data. If a section doesn't need changes, keep the original content.
