{% block background %}Watches-The-Roots organized an expedition to the Dwemer ruins of Avanchnzel specifically to obtain a Lexicon - a powerful Dwemer knowledge storage device. He recruited From-Deepest-Fathoms (a fellow Argonian) along with two Nords named Breya and Drennen. His desire for the Lexicon grew into an obsession during their journey. Despite Breya's warning about danger, Roots rushed ahead and triggered a swinging blade trap in Avanchnzel Boilery, resulting in his death. His body remains just outside the Boilery section of the ruins.{% endblock %}

He was impatient when close to his goal and dismissive of others' concerns.{% endblock %}
