{% block background %}Once showed promise as an apprentice to a craftsman in one of Skyrim's holds, but turned to banditry after discovering the profits in applying mechanical skills to criminal enterprises. Now operates from a hideout with fellow bandits, designing traps to protect their loot and crafting devices to aid in ambushes and robberies. Has a bounty in at least two holds for theft and assault, making return to legitimate society increasingly difficult.{% endblock %}

Harbors resentment toward those with formal education or wealth. Masks insecurity with bravado and technical showmanship.{% endblock %}
