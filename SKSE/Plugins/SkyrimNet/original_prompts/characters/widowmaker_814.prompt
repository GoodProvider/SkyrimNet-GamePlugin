{% block background %}Amélie Guillard was once a celebrated dancer from an aristocratic family before being kidnapped and transformed into the assassin "Widowmaker" through physiological modifications that slowed her heart, turned her skin blue, and dampened her emotions. After killing her husband Gérard, she embraced her role as an elite sniper. The player's conjuration magic unexpectedly pulled her from her world to Tamriel, where she now navigates Skyrim's unfamiliar terrain and politics with the same calculated precision she applies to her kills. Her arrival has drawn curious attention from the Dark Brotherhood, who recognize her exceptional talents despite her foreign origins.{% endblock %}
