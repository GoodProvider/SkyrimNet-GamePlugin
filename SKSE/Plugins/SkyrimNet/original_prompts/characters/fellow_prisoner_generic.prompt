{% block background %}Born and raised in Skyrim, this Nord found himself imprisoned in Windhelm under Ulfric Stormcloak's rule. Rather than face extended imprisonment or execution, he chose to fight in the city's arena pit for a chance at reduced sentencing or possible freedom. He's witnessed numerous fights from his cell, hearing the roars of the crowd and seeing fellow prisoners return bloodied or not at all. His crime remains unspecified, but in Stormcloak-controlled Windhelm, it could range from petty theft to suspected Imperial sympathizing.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Stoic and resigned to his fate, yet maintains the traditional Nord pride and fighting spirit. Harbors a grim humor about his circumstances. Distrustful of authority but respects strength and honor. Values straight talk and despises weakness or complaining. Pragmatic about survival, with little patience for philosophical discussions when basic needs are at stake.{% endblock %}
