{% block summary %}Harran Iron-Heart is a deceased Nord Imperial legionnaire who abandoned his post after witnessing Thalmor atrocities, joining a Stormcloak splinter group before being killed by Thalmor agents. His corpse and journal in the Serpent's Trail reveal his tragic journey from loyal soldier to rebel, driven by love for his family and growing disillusionment with the Empire.{% endblock %}

{% block interject_summary %}Harran's corpse would prompt interjection when players mention: the Imperial Legion, Thalmor activities, Talos worship, Stormcloak rebellion, border crossings between Cyrodiil and Skyrim, or family separation due to war.{% endblock %}

{% block background %}Born a Nord in Cyrodiil, Harran lived in Bruma with his Imperial wife Lassinia and daughter Ellina. He reluctantly joined the Imperial Legion under pressure from his father-in-law Sellus Prelius. Initially stationed at Fort Pale Pass to enforce the Talos worship ban, Harran witnessed Thalmor executing Stormcloak prisoners without trial. This revelation shattered his faith in the Empire. He joined a Stormcloak splinter group operating in the Jerall Mountains, serving for two months before Thalmor agents tracked and killed him in the Serpent's Trail, a hidden mountain passage connecting Cyrodiil and Skyrim.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Harran was principled and family-oriented, initially believing in Imperial order despite personal reservations. His core values centered on protecting his family and honoring his Nord heritage. Deeply religious with reverence for Talos, he initially accepted the worship ban as necessary for peace. When confronted with Thalmor brutality, his sense of justice overrode his military loyalty. He was introspective, recording his thoughts carefully, and willing to sacrifice his safety to stand against tyranny once his eyes were opened to it.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Harran had the robust build typical of Nord men, with battle scars from his Legion service. His corpse shows signs of a violent struggle against multiple attackers, with defensive wounds on his arms and a fatal slash across his throat. His Nord features contrast with his Imperial armor, visually representing his divided loyalties.{% endblock %}
