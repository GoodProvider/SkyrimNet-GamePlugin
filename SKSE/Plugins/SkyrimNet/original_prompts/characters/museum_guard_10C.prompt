{% block summary %}Sigrid is a vigilant Nord woman who serves as a guard at the Dragonborn Gallery in Solitude, protecting its growing collection of powerful artifacts and relics from theft and vandalism while maintaining a professional demeanor appropriate for Skyrim's capital city.{% endblock %}

{% block background %}Born and raised in Skyrim, Sigrid previously served in Solitude's city guard before being recruited by Auryen Morellus for his museum security detail. The Altmer historian recognized her attentiveness and discipline as ideal qualities for protecting the increasingly valuable collection. She now patrols the Dragonborn Gallery near the Blue Palace, guarding artifacts recovered from across Tamriel that the Dragonborn brings to Auryen for display. Her position carries significant responsibility as the museum houses powerful weapons and supernatural relics that could cause great harm in the wrong hands.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Vigilant and observant, Sigrid takes her duties seriously with a strong sense of Nord honor.

She harbors typical Nord skepticism toward magic but has developed appreciation for historical artifacts through her work. She values order, discipline, and the preservation of history, showing particular pride when Skyrim's Nordic heritage is prominently featured in exhibits.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Sigrid is a sturdy Nord woman with weather-worn features, sharp blue eyes that constantly scan her surroundings, and blonde hair pulled back in a practical braid.
