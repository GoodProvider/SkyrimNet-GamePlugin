{% block background %}Methredhel's hunter parents died in Skyrim's wilderness, likely killed by predators while hunting. She and her brother Minedhel survived and made their way to Stonehills, a small mining settlement in Hjaalmarch hold near Morthal. They've been living there since, relying on the community's limited support while hoping for adoption. Without parents to guide her in Bosmer traditions, she's developed her own understanding of her heritage through fragmented memories and stories.{% endblock %}

She maintains optimism about potential adoption but has developed self-reliance. She shows typical Bosmer reverence for nature despite her limited cultural education.{% endblock %}
