{% block background %}Born and raised in the Imperial City, Voltan enlisted in the Legion at a young age, rising through ranks during the Great War. His unit specialized in tactical response and precision strikes against Aldmeri forces. After 15 years of distinguished service, he took honorable discharge rather than enforce the White-Gold Concordat's Talos ban. He traveled to Skyrim seeking mercenary work where his tactical expertise would be valued without political constraints. His Legion training emphasized discipline, precision, and strategic thinking—qualities now rare in Skyrim's chaotic civil war.{% endblock %}
