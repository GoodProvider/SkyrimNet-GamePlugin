{% block background %}Born to Bosmer hunter parents who taught him basic wilderness skills and Bosmeri traditions, Minedhel's life changed dramatically when both parents died during a hunting expedition in Skyrim's harsh wilderness. He led his younger sister Methredhel on a dangerous journey to Stonehills, a small mining settlement in Hjaalmarch hold. The siblings have survived through odd jobs and the reluctant charity of miners and travelers, but remain in a precarious situation. Despite their circumstances, Minedhel preserves what little Bosmeri culture he remembers, teaching his sister their heritage while hoping for adoption by a stable family.{% endblock %}

{% block speech_style %}Speaks with a slight Bosmeri accent, using simpler vocabulary appropriate for a child but occasionally employing surprisingly mature phrasing. Voice shifts between confident when discussing survival matters and hesitant when addressing adults about needs. Tends to speak directly and practically, without flourish. When nervous, speaks more rapidly and at higher pitch. Uses "we" more often than "I," always including his sister in his thinking.{% endblock %}
