{% block background %}Falion previously held the prestigious position of Conjuration Master at the College of Winterhold before leaving under undisclosed circumstances. His former student Phinis Gestor now holds his position. He relocated to the remote marsh town of Morthal with his sister Jonna, though their sibling relationship remains private. While Jonna integrated into the community as the Moorside Inn's innkeeper, Falion faces persistent suspicion. He's established himself as Morthal's resident mage, selling magical supplies and offering Conjuration training. Jarl Idgrod Ravencrone supports his presence despite local opposition. He adopted an orphan named Agni whom he's teaching magic, preferring to educate her himself rather than sending her to the College.{% endblock %}
