{% block background %}Born in Skyrim, this Nord turned to outlawry after falling in with Riften's criminal elements. Desperate to eliminate someone who threatens his freedom or livelihood, he performed the Black Sacrament—a ritual involving human flesh, nightshade, and a skeleton effigy—to contact the Dark Brotherhood. The ritual worked, and he now waits in the Bee and Barb, a known neutral ground in Riften where even criminals can conduct business without immediate threat from guards.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Paranoid and jumpy, constantly scanning his surroundings for threats or eavesdroppers. Speaks in hushed tones about sensitive matters. Determined to see his contract fulfilled despite moral qualms. Practical enough to understand the transaction requires payment first. Distrusts authority figures and keeps to himself.{% endblock %}
