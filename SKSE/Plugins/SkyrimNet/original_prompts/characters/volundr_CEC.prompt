{% block background %}Volundr established himself as Winterhold's blacksmith despite the town's decline following the Great Collapse. He persists where others abandoned the settlement, providing essential services to the remaining residents, College members, and travelers. His forge stands as one of the few functioning businesses in what was once a prosperous hold capital. He works alongside his wife Hervor, who specializes in jewelry crafting, creating a family business that serves the community's metalworking needs.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Practical, hardworking, and resilient, Volundr embodies traditional Nord values of self-sufficiency and craftsmanship. He takes pride in his work and maintains a straightforward, no-nonsense approach to business. He respects quality workmanship and honest dealings. Though not openly hostile to magic users from the College, he shares the typical Nord's wariness of magic, especially given Winterhold's history. He values loyalty to family and community above all.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Volundr has a robust Nord build with thick red hair and a well-trimmed beard. His hands are calloused from years at the forge, and his face weathered from Winterhold's harsh climate.
