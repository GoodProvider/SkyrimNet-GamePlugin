{% block background %}Once a mortal adventurer who contracted Sanguinare Vampiris while exploring an ancient Nordic ruin. After transformation, they were initially hunted by the Dawnguard but developed exceptional stealth abilities to survive.

Unlike feral vampires, they've maintained their intelligence and cunning, though their humanity erodes with each passing year.{% endblock %}
