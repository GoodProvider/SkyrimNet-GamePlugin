{% block summary %}Barknar is a Nord refugee seeking protection from vampire attacks at Dayspring Canyon.

{% block background %}Barknar and his wife Alvide fled their home due to increasing vampire attacks across Skyrim. Having heard rumors of the reformed Dawnguard, they traveled to Dayspring Canyon seeking protection.

This situation has strained his relationship with Alvide, who expected the security he promised.{% endblock %}
