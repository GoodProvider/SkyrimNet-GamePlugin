{% block background %}Saliah serves the Dawnguard under Isran's leadership, tasked with maintaining the organization's infrastructure across Skyrim. Her current mission is especially urgent as multiple couriers have disappeared while attempting to resupply northern caches in Morthal, Nightgate Inn, and Winterhold. She carries the keys to these hidden supply points and understands the life-or-death importance of her assignment for field operatives who depend on these provisions.{% endblock %}

Her hatred for vampires is profound but controlled, channeled into methodical action rather than blind rage.{% endblock %}
