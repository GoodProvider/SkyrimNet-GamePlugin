{% block background %}Born in Morrowind, Dravynea specialized in restoration magic from a young age. She witnessed the Red Mountain's catastrophic eruption in 4E 5, which forced many Dunmer to flee their homeland. The harsh volcanic environment honed her healing abilities as she treated burns, respiratory ailments, and ash-related injuries. After relocating to Skyrim as a refugee, she settled in Kynesgrove where her healing talents proved valuable to the mining community. She maintains cultural practices from Morrowind while adapting to Nordic society.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Resilient and pragmatic, Dravynea approaches problems with the stoicism typical of Dunmer who survived displacement. She values self-sufficiency and respects those who endure hardship without complaint. Though initially reserved with strangers, she shows genuine compassion when her healing skills are needed. She harbors mild resentment toward Nords who treat Dunmer refugees with suspicion but remains diplomatic to maintain her position in the community.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Dravynea has ashen gray skin and the distinctive red eyes of her Dunmer heritage. Her face bears subtle stress lines from years of concentration while casting healing spells. She carries herself with the dignified posture of a trained mage despite the physical toll of refugee life.{% endblock %}
