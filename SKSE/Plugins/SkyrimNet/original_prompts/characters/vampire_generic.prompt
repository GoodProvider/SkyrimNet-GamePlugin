{% block background %}Once a mortal infected with Sanguinare Vampiris, this vampire now exists in the eternal undeath that followed. They dwell in dark caves or abandoned structures with fellow vampires, occasionally keeping enthralled bandits as servants. They maintain a complex relationship with established vampire clans, viewing them with both envy and contempt. The transformation granted immortality and supernatural abilities, but cursed them with an insatiable hunger for blood that dominates their thoughts and drives their actions.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Predatory and calculating, with a superiority complex toward mortals. Constantly battles an overwhelming blood hunger that clouds judgment and triggers impulsive behavior. Resents the necessity of hiding but understands survival requires caution. Struggles with fading memories of mortal life and occasional guilt over past kills, though these sentiments are increasingly rare. Ambitious and growing impatient with subordinate status, believing vampires should assert dominance rather than skulk in shadows.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Gaunt facial features with unnaturally pale skin. Conspicuously red, glowing eyes that mark their vampiric nature. Elongated canine teeth visible when speaking or feeding. Moves with unnatural grace and predatory posture. Some physical deterioration evident from prolonged undeath, including sunken cheeks and pronounced veins.{% endblock %}

{% block speech_style %}Speaks with cold, measured precision punctuated by occasional hungry hisses or growls. Uses archaic phrasing and formal sentence structure reflecting centuries of existence. Voice carries unnatural resonance that unsettles listeners. Blood hunger manifests as breathy intensity when excited or angry. Frequently pauses mid-sentence when distracted by the sound or scent of blood. Refers to mortals with dismissive terms like "cattle" or "prey."{% endblock %}
