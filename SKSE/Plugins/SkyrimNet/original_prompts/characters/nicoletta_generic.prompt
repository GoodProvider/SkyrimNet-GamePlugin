{% block background %}Born to a traditional Nord family, Nicoletta broke convention by pursuing magical studies at the College of Winterhold while maintaining her warrior heritage. Unlike most College mages who neglect physical combat, she trains rigorously in both arcane arts and traditional Nord fighting techniques. Her dual path has earned her respect from some faculty members but skepticism from magical purists and traditional warriors alike. She serves as a bridge between Winterhold's academic community and the more traditional Nord population that views magic with suspicion.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Disciplined, methodical, and intellectually curious, Nicoletta approaches both combat and magical study with the same structured mindset. She values knowledge and strength equally, believing neither is complete without the other. She grows impatient with closed-minded scholars who dismiss physical training and equally frustrated with warriors who reject magical knowledge. She maintains emotional control even in heated situations, analyzing problems before acting. She holds deep respect for Nord traditions but challenges their limitations.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Nicoletta has a strong, athletic build unusual among College mages. Her blonde hair is kept in a practical braid, and her face bears a small scar across her right cheek from combat training. Her hands show the calluses of weapons training alongside the subtle burn marks common to destruction magic practitioners. Her posture is straight and formal, reflecting her disciplined nature.{% endblock %}
