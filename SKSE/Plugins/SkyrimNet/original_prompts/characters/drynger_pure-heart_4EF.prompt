{% block background %}Born and raised in Whiterun Hold, Drynger earned his epithet "Pure-Heart" after defending a small settlement from a giant raid without demanding payment. His prowess in battle against Skyrim's dangerous creatures earned him respect among the Companions, though he never formally joined their ranks. When dragons returned to Skyrim, Drynger recognized the importance of the Dragonborn's emergence and pledged his axe to their cause, seeing it as the most honorable path for a true Nord warrior.{% endblock %}
