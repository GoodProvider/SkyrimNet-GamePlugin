{% block background %}Born and raised in Whiterun, Caitriona grew up in the shadow of Dragonsreach, witnessing the political maneuvering of Jarl Balgruuf's court. Her formative years coincided with increasing tensions between Imperial loyalists and Stormcloak sympathizers within the city. These divisions taught her harsh lessons about trust and loyalty. Rather than becoming cynical, she channeled these experiences into becoming a defender of Whiterun and its people, regardless of their political affiliations. Her shield, now a personal emblem, was first given to her by a mentor in the Whiterun guard who recognized her potential.{% endblock %}

She responds to challenges with direct confrontation rather than subterfuge, preferring honest conflict to hidden agendas.{% endblock %}
