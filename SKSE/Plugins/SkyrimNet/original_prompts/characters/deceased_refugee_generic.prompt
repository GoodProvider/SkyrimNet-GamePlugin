{% block background %}Born and raised in Helgen, this Nord worked the surrounding farmland his entire life until the day Alduin attacked. He witnessed the black dragon's devastating assault on the town, managing to escape the inferno with a fellow townsman. They fled north along the road, carrying only what they could grab in haste. Their journey ended abruptly when they were killedâ€”likely by bandits, wolves, or other dangers common to Skyrim's roads. Their bodies now lie as silent testimony to both Helgen's destruction and the perilous nature of travel in the province.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}In life, this Nord embodied the hardy, practical nature typical of Skyrim's farming class. He valued hard work, self-sufficiency, and community bonds. Loyal to his hometown and fellow Nords, he maintained traditional Nordic beliefs including respect for the Divines, particularly Talos despite the Empire's ban. He harbored a natural distrust of magic users and non-Nord races common among rural Skyrim inhabitants.{% endblock %}
