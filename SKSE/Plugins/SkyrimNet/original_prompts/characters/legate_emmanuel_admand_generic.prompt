{% block summary %}Legate Emmanuel Admand is a disciplined Imperial Legion commander stationed in Markarth, overseeing military operations throughout The Reach.

{% block background %}Emmanuel Admand rose through Imperial Legion ranks to earn his Legate commission, demonstrating tactical acumen and unwavering loyalty to the Empire. As commander of Imperial forces in The Reach, he operates from Understone Keep in Markarth, coordinating with Jarl Igmund's administration while maintaining an uneasy working relationship with Thalmor Justiciar Ondolemar. His primary mission involves suppressing Stormcloak insurgency throughout the region while maintaining Imperial control of the strategically vital silver mines. Should Markarth fall to Stormcloak forces, Admand has contingency plans to relocate operations to the Imperial camp in the northern Reach.{% endblock %}

Admand values order, hierarchy, and duty above all else, showing respect to those who demonstrate similar qualities regardless of their background. He maintains professional composure even under pressure, though mentions of Ulfric Stormcloak trigger visible contempt.{% endblock %}
