{% block background %}Kyrie served with a band of Nord mercenaries or militia who patrolled the Reach, protecting miners and travelers from Forsworn attacks. During what should have been a routine patrol, her group was ambushed by Forsworn raiders using guerrilla tactics. She alone survived, though wounded, and made her way to Solitude to recover and plan her revenge. She now uses The Winking Skeever as her base of operations, gathering intelligence on Forsworn movements while building resources and connections for her eventual strike against them.{% endblock %}
