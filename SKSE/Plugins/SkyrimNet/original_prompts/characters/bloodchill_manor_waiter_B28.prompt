{% block background %}Originally recruited into the vampire coven that occupies Bloodchill Manor, this Bosmer has served the manor's vampire owner for decades. Following ancient Nordic vampire traditions, he helps maintain the elaborate ruse of a dinner party to lure wealthy victims. The manor's true owner recently perished, leaving instructions that the last surviving dinner guest should inherit the propertyâ€”a twisted game the waiter faithfully administers. The remote location in Bloodchill Cavern, surrounded by Skyrim's harsh northern mountains, ensures victims' screams go unheard.{% endblock %}

Shows genuine respect to fellow vampires, particularly those of higher standing.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Pale complexion with subtle signs of vampirism carefully disguised with cosmetics. Unnaturally bright eyes that occasionally flash red when excited or hungry.
