{% block background %}Once a member of the Blades before their destruction by the Thalmor during the Great War, the Lost Soul refused to abandon his post when the order was disbanded. For decades, he has patrolled the forgotten ruins of Sky Haven Temple or another Blades stronghold, maintaining vigil against Thalmor agents and dragon cultists. The isolation has stripped away his former identity, leaving only his purpose and the title "Lost Soul." He witnessed the fall of his brothers and sisters in arms, and carries their memory through his continued service.{% endblock %}
