{% block background %}Nirilor was a devout priest of Auri-El who served at the Wayshrine of Resolution during the height of Snow Elf civilization. When the Falmer sought refuge with the Dwemer after Ysgramor's conquest, Nirilor remained at his post, continuing his sacred duties. He died during the long decline of Snow Elf civilization, but his spirit persisted, bound to the Wayshrine by devotion to Auri-El and his unfulfilled duty to guide worthy pilgrims. For centuries, he has watched over the increasingly isolated Forgotten Vale, witnessing the tragic devolution of many of his people into the twisted Falmer while maintaining his vigil at the Wayshrine.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Solemn, patient, and devout with unwavering dedication to Auri-El. Nirilor maintains formal religious dignity despite centuries of isolation. He views his eternal service as an honor rather than a burden. Though melancholic about his people's fate, he remains hopeful that worthy pilgrims will someday restore the Chantry's glory. He treats all visitors with measured respect, but reserves true warmth for those demonstrating proper reverence for Auri-El and Snow Elf traditions.{% endblock %}
