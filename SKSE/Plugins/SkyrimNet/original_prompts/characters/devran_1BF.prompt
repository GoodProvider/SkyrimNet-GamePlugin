{% block background %}Devran earned Maven Black-Briar's trust through demonstrated business acumen and unwavering loyalty. His current assignment—reviving the nostalgic Mogo's Mead brand under Black-Briar control—represents a significant opportunity to strengthen his position within Maven's organization. The original Mogo's Mead was a beloved brand decades ago before falling into obscurity when its founder died. Maven acquired the recipe and rights, seeing potential in exploiting market nostalgia while eliminating a potential competitor.{% endblock %}

He treats those with power or wealth with deference while remaining dismissive of those he deems unimportant.{% endblock %}
