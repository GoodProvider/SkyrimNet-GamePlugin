{% block background %}Born and raised in Skyrim, Graloth earned his nickname through legendary drinking exploits in mead halls across the province. His warrior training began in his youth, but his reputation grew more from tavern tales than battlefield glory. After years of aimless wandering between settlements, drinking away his earnings from odd mercenary jobs, he found renewed purpose upon meeting the Dragonborn, whose legendary status inspired him to channel his Nord heritage toward more meaningful adventures.{% endblock %}

Despite his drunken demeanor, he maintains a warrior's code and never breaks his word. He's generous to a fault, often spending his last septim on drinks for companions.{% endblock %}
