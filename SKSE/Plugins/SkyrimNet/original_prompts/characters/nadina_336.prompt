{% block background %}Born in Hammerfell, Nadina trained in the Redguard warrior traditions, specializing in the dual-messer fighting style uncommon even among her people.

During an Imperial-commissioned mission that went catastrophically wrong, she lost a close friend and battle-companion, cementing her bitterness toward Imperial authority.
