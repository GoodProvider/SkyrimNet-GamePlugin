{% block background %}Lucia was raised on a farm with her mother until tragedy struck. After her mother's death, her aunt and uncle inherited the property and promptly evicted her, claiming she was worthless. With nowhere else to go, she made her way to Whiterun where she now survives on the streets. The local beggar Brenuin took pity on her, teaching her how to beg effectively enough to survive. She spends her days near the Gildergreen and Temple of Kynareth, seeking shelter in the Bannered Mare during evenings before sleeping on the cold ground behind the inn.{% endblock %}
