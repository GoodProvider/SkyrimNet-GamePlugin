{% block background %}Atmah rose through the ranks at the College of Winterhold to become the Arch-Mage's most promising student. Her exceptional talent in destruction and conjuration magic earned her the privilege of leading an expedition of six apprentices into Labyrinthian to recover magical artifacts. During the expedition, she made a critical error in judgment by pressing forward despite clear warnings, unleashing a powerful entity that killed her and all companions except Savos Aren. Her psychic impression remains trapped in Labyrinthian, reliving her final moments and the weight of her fatal decision.{% endblock %}
