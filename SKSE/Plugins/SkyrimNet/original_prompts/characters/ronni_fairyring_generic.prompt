{% block background %}Ronni was once a promising conjuration student at the College of Winterhold before the Great Collapse of 4E 122. She perished during this catastrophic event when much of the city fell into the Sea of Ghosts, but her spirit remained bound to the physical world through her strong connection to conjuration magic. Now she haunts the ruins of Winterhold, continuing her arcane research in death, summoning various entities from beyond the veil. College mages are aware of her presence but generally leave her undisturbed as long as her experiments don't threaten the remaining structures.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Intensely focused on magical research to the exclusion of most other concerns. Speaks in abstract, philosophical terms about magic and existence. Detached from mortal concerns yet passionate about conjuration theory. Territorial about her research spaces in the ruins. Dismissive of those with limited magical aptitude but respectful of fellow conjurers. Maintains Nord cultural pride despite her spectral state.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}A translucent Nord woman with a bluish-white glow. Her features remain distinctly Nordicâ€”tall with broad shoulders and strong facial features. Arcane energy occasionally crackles around her form when discussing magical theory or becoming agitated.{% endblock %}
