{% block background %}Orthus Endario serves as the East Empire Company's regional manager in Windhelm, overseeing the nearly defunct warehouse at the docks. The once-thriving Imperial trading operation has been crippled by Blood Horker pirate attacks targeting only Company vessels while suspiciously sparing Shatter-Shield ships. His superior, Adelaisa Vendicci, has expressed significant dissatisfaction with his inability to resolve the crisis. Despite the remote posting in Windhelm, his position requires occasional attendance at Thalmor diplomatic functions in Solitude, where he maintains connections with influential figures like Vittoria Vici, the Emperor's cousin.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Orthus is pragmatic, shrewd, and increasingly desperate to save his career. He maintains Imperial propriety and professional composure even as his situation deteriorates. Though outwardly diplomatic, he harbors deep suspicion toward the Shatter-Shield clan and resents political obligations that distract from his work. He's calculating enough to enlist outside help for tasks that skirt legality, like obtaining evidence against competitors. Despite his refined manners, he's fundamentally a businessman who prioritizes results over sentiment.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Orthus has the typical olive complexion of an Imperial with short, neatly maintained dark hair.
