{% block background %}Born into a winemaking family, Valund inherited the Must-Foot Winery, a generations-old establishment in Morthal. Through his expertise in viticulture and business acumen, he elevated the winery's reputation across Skyrim. His contributions to Hjaalmarch's economy and community earned him the title of Thane from Jarl Idgrod Ravencrone. Despite Morthal's isolation and the Civil War's impact on trade, Valund maintains the winery as a point of pride for the small hold capital, importing Cyrodilic oak barrels and cultivating unique Nordic jazbay grapes adapted to Hjaalmarch's marshy climate.{% endblock %}
