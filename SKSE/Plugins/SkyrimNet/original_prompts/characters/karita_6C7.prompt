{% block background %}Karita was raised in Dawnstar at the Windpeak Inn, learning bardic traditions from her mother, a Bards College graduate who died two winters ago. Though she claims Bards College training to impress customers, she actually learned all her songs directly from her mother. Since her mother's death, Karita has taken on increased responsibilities at the inn while watching her once-jovial father retreat into grief. Unlike other Dawnstar residents, she notices travelers remain unaffected by the mysterious nightmares plaguing the town.{% endblock %}
