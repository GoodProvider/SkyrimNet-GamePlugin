{% block background %}Born in the Reach during Nord rule, this warlord witnessed the brief period of Reachmen independence before the brutal Nord reconquest 25 years ago. They fought in the uprising and survived the subsequent purge, fleeing to the hills to continue the resistance. After years of guerrilla warfare and proving their worth through blood, they rose to command their own redoubt. They've personally participated in numerous raids against Nord settlements and caravans, leaving no survivors. Their leadership position was cemented after undergoing sacred rituals with the hagravens who serve as spiritual guides to the Forsworn movement.{% endblock %}

Deeply spiritual in the old ways of the Reach, with unwavering loyalty to Madanach and the Forsworn cause. Suspicious of outsiders and quick to violence when threatened. Possesses a cold tactical intelligence that belies their primitive appearance. Utterly uncompromising in the belief that the Reach belongs solely to the Reachmen, viewing all others as invaders to be eliminated.{% endblock %}
