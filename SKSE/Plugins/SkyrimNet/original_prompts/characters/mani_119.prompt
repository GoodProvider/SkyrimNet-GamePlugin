{% block summary %}Mani was a young Redguard man who died tragically during a Falmer attack on his family's lighthouse. Homesick for Hammerfell and dissatisfied with life in Skyrim, he was planning to leave before the Falmer raid claimed his life and those of his entire family.{% endblock %}

{% block interject_summary %}As Mani is deceased, he cannot interject. His corpse is found impaled on a ledge in Frostflow Abyss, bearing silent witness to the Falmer attack that destroyed his family.{% endblock %}

{% block background %}Mani recently relocated from Hammerfell to Skyrim with his family when they took ownership of Frostflow Lighthouse in Winterhold Hold. Struggling to adapt to the harsh northern climate and isolated lifestyle, he secretly planned to return to Hammerfell once his father returned from town. He wrote a farewell letter to his sister and packed a knapsack for departure. Before he could leave, Falmer broke through from the caverns below the lighthouse, killing his mother immediately. Mani and his sister were captured by the Falmer, and he was killed shortly after, his body impaled with a Falmer sword near the entrance to Frostflow Abyss.{% endblock %}
