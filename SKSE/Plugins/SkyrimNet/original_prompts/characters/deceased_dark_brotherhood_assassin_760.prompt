{% block background %}This Nord assassin served the Dark Brotherhood, an ancient organization of assassins who worship Sithis and follow the Night Mother. He operated during the Fourth Era when the Brotherhood was in decline across Tamriel. His presence at Hag's End, a remote Nordic ruin controlled by Forsworn hagravens, indicates he was likely on a contract targeting someone hiding within or connected to the Forsworn. The northern Reach location is significant - far from Brotherhood sanctuaries, suggesting either a high-value target or a mission of particular importance to the Brotherhood.{% endblock %}
