{% block background %}Born in the murky depths of Black Marsh, Teeka-Dulei was trained by Hist-sap shamans in the arts of restoration. During the Argonian uprising against Morrowind slavers, he developed stealth skills to infiltrate holdings and free his captured kin. The harsh climate of Skyrim initially challenged his cold-blooded physiology, but he adapted by developing specialized warming enchantments. He traveled north seeking rare alchemical ingredients only found in Skyrim's harsh climate, eventually offering his unique combination of healing and stealth expertise to worthy allies.{% endblock %}

He harbors deep distrust toward Dunmer due to their history of enslaving Argonians. His humor is dry and often delivered deadpan. He demonstrates patience when healing others but becomes visibly agitated when his restoration skills are underestimated or dismissed.{% endblock %}
