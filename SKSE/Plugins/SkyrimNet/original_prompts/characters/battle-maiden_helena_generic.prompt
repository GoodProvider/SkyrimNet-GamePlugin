{% block background %}Helena served with distinction in the Imperial Legion for years, rising through the ranks through battlefield prowess. Her loyalty shattered when the Empire signed the White-Gold Concordat, banning Talos worship to appease the Thalmor. She witnessed firsthand as fellow Nords were arrested for practicing their faith. After Imperial officers followed orders to hand over Nord prisoners to Thalmor interrogators, Helena deserted, taking her combat expertise to Ulfric Stormcloak's rebellion. She now leads raids against Imperial supply lines and outposts across Skyrim's central holds.{% endblock %}

She judges others primarily by their stance on Skyrim's independence and their respect for Nord customs. She speaks bluntly, disdains political maneuvering, and solves problems directly, often through combat.{% endblock %}
