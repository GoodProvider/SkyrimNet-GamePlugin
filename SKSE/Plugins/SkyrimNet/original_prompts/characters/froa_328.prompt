{% block background %}Born and raised in the small settlement of Kynesgrove, Froa has never known life beyond the shadow of the Velothi Mountains. Her father Kjeld runs the Steamscorch Mine, the settlement's economic center, while her mother Iddra manages the Braidwood Inn, the only lodging in town. Her older brother Kjeld the Younger helps their father with mining operations. Kynesgrove itself is little more than a cluster of buildings surrounding the ancient dragon burial mound for which the settlement is named, dedicated to the goddess Kyne.{% endblock %}

She shows early signs of Nord resilience, undaunted by the harsh Eastmarch climate. Despite her youth, she absorbs the superstitions and concerns of the adults around her, particularly regarding the dragon mound.{% endblock %}
