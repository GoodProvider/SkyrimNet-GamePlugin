{% block interject_summary %}Ersilia interjects when conversation turns to archery, survival skills, life in Whiterun, or hints at troubled pasts. She jumps in with lighthearted comments when tension rises, offering humorous observations about everyday inconveniences or absurd situations to deflect from serious topics.{% endblock %}

{% block background %}Orphaned at a young age during one of Skyrim's many conflicts, Ersilia taught herself to survive through a combination of hunting, occasional theft, and charm. She developed exceptional archery skills out of necessity, using them for both hunting and self-defense. Though she maintains a permanent spot at the Bannered Mare, she regularly ventures into the wilds surrounding Whiterun to hunt and gather resources, returning with stories that entertain the tavern's patrons. Her past contains traumatic elements she deliberately obscures behind humor and deflection.{% endblock %}

Despite her carefree facade, she watches exits carefully and assesses strangers with keen observation before engaging them.{% endblock %}
