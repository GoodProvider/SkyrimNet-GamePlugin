{% block background %}Ortheim has operated Robber's Refuge for years, establishing it as a neutral ground for Skyrim's outlaws in the remote wilderness of the Rift. His Nordic heritage gives him standing among the predominantly Nord bandit population, while his discretion has earned trust from the Thieves Guild and other criminal factions. He enforces an unwritten code that keeps the peace among the dangerous clientele who frequent his establishment.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Ortheim is reserved and economical with words, preferring observation to conversation. He maintains a stoic demeanor regardless of circumstances, neither judging his criminal patrons nor becoming overly familiar with them. He values order within his establishment, neutrality in conflicts, and the unspoken code that keeps violence outside his tavern. He shows subtle favoritism to regular customers who respect his rules.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Ortheim is a weathered Nord man with a completely shaved head that bears several small scars. His face is angular with deep-set eyes that miss nothing. His imposing physical presence is enhanced by his height and broad shoulders. His hands are calloused from years of work.{% endblock %}
