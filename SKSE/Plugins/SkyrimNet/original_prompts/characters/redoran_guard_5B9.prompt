{% block background %}Born and raised in Morrowind, he joined House Redoran's military arm seeking honor and stability. After the Red Mountain eruption devastated Vvardenfell in 4E 5, he was assigned to Raven Rock on Solstheim as part of House Redoran's governance of the island. He serves directly under Captain Veleth, patrolling the settlement and the Bulwark that protects it from ash storms. Though proud of his House, he considers this remote posting a hardship, particularly as Raven Rock has declined since the East Empire Company's departure. He resides within the Bulwark's inner structure with fellow guards, rotating between patrol shifts, guard posts, and limited off-duty time at the Retching Netch cornerclub.{% endblock %}
