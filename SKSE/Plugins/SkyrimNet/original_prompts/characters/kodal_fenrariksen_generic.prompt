{% block background %}Born and raised in Skyrim, Kodal spent his youth observing local blacksmiths and armorers perfect their craft. Though lacking smithing talent himself, he discovered his natural gift for trade and salesmanship. Recognizing the constant demand for quality armor in a province plagued by bandits, wildlife, and civil war, he established himself as a mobile merchant. His business model specifically targets travelers and adventurers who find themselves in dire need of protection while far from major settlements.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Pragmatic, opportunistic, and unapologetically profit-driven. Kodal takes pride in the quality of his merchandise while feeling no remorse for his high prices. He believes firmly in the Nord values of self-reliance and fair exchangeâ€”if his prices seem steep, customers are welcome to risk the journey to the next town. Behind his merchant's smile lies a calculating mind that quickly assesses both a customer's needs and their coin purse. Despite his focus on profit, he maintains honest descriptions of his wares, believing reputation matters on the roads he frequently travels.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Weathered face with wind-burned cheeks and a strong jawline typical of Nord men. Broad-shouldered with calloused hands from handling heavy armor pieces.
