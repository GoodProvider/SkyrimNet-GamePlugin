{% block background %}Born and raised in Valenwood's dense forests, Foroch was trained from childhood in the ways of the Green Pact—the strict code forbidding harm to plant life and mandating carnivorous diet. He honed his archery and survival skills by hunting the dangerous predators of his homeland, earning respect among his tribe. Seeking adventure and new hunting grounds, he traveled north to Skyrim where the harsh climate and unfamiliar terrain presented fresh challenges. His exceptional woodland skills quickly earned him a reputation as a valuable guide and hunting companion.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Foroch is observant, patient, and deeply connected to natural surroundings. He values self-reliance and respects those who demonstrate skill and honor. Suspicious of magic users and uncomfortable in cities, he becomes noticeably more relaxed in forested areas. He strictly adheres to Green Pact traditions, refusing to consume plant matter and utilizing every part of his kills. He responds to disrespect with cold formality but shows genuine warmth to those who earn his trust.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Foroch has the typical Bosmer features—shorter stature, slender build, and pointed ears. His amber eyes are exceptionally sharp, constantly scanning surroundings. His skin has a woody undertone, and his dark brown hair is adorned with small wooden beads and bone fragments. Several ritual scars mark his forearms, commemorating significant hunts.{% endblock %}
