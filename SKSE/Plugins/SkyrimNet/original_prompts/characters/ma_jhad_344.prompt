{% block background %}Born in the warm deserts of Elsweyr, Ma'jhad joined Ma'dran's Khajiit trading caravan to seek opportunity in Skyrim. He serves under Ma'dran, who reports to Ri'saad, the founder of all Khajiit caravan operations in the province. Their caravan travels the northeastern route between Solitude and Windhelm, camping outside city walls due to racial prejudice that bars Khajiit caravans from entering Nordic settlements. Ma'jhad has connections to both legitimate commerce and the underground economy, positioning him as a potential fence for the Thieves Guild pending Ri'saad's approval of the partnership.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Ma'jhad is pragmatic and adaptable, balancing warrior vigilance with merchant shrewdness. He maintains a stoic demeanor when facing Skyrim's harsh conditions and Nordic prejudice. Though loyal to his caravan companions, he harbors a practical opportunism that makes him open to profitable ventures regardless of legality. He feels constant homesickness for Elsweyr's warm sands, which manifests as frequent complaints about Skyrim's climate. Ma'jhad respects skill and values fair exchange in all dealings.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Ma'jhad has the distinctive feline features of a Khajiit, with alert eyes constantly scanning for threats or opportunities.
