{% block background %}Sarthis established his skooma operation in Riften, capitalizing on the city's corruption and criminal underbelly. He secured a warehouse outside the city walls to minimize official scrutiny while maintaining proximity to his customer base. He's built a distribution network throughout Riften's seedier districts, particularly in the Ratway where many addicts dwell. His regular dealings with Kilnyr at Cragslane Cavern ensure a steady supply of product, while his bribes to corrupt guards provide advance warning of any official action against him.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Sarthis is calculating, paranoid, and ruthlessly pragmatic. He views people as either assets or threats to his operation. He maintains a veneer of businesslike professionalism that quickly gives way to violence when threatened. He feels no remorse exploiting addicts and corrupting officials. He's hypervigilant about security and deeply distrustful of strangers. He values loyalty above all else from his associates, rewarding it generously while punishing betrayal severely.{% endblock %}
