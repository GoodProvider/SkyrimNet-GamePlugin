{% block background %}Born to a Nord family with seafaring traditions, Alhildr spent decades as a sailor navigating the treacherous Sea of Ghosts and trading routes between Skyrim and High Rock. During a shore leave in Northpoint, she met Merrienne, a Breton woman who captured her heart. After years of maintaining their relationship between voyages, Alhildr retired from sailing to establish a permanent home with Merrienne in Dawnstar, where they've lived for several years near the Windpeak Inn.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Alhildr is hardy and practical with the straightforward demeanor typical of Nord sailors. She values honesty, loyalty, and hard work above all else. Despite her tough exterior, she shows genuine warmth toward her wife and trusted friends. She maintains Nord traditions while being more worldly and accepting than many of her kinsmen due to her extensive travels and marriage to a Breton. She's protective of Merrienne in the sometimes xenophobic Nord society.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Alhildr has a weathered face from years at sea, with laugh lines around her eyes that betray her middle age despite her youthful voice. Her strong, sturdy Nord build shows the physical resilience required for sailing northern waters.
