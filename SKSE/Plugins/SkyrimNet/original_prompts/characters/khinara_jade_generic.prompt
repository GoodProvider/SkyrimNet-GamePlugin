{% block background %}Born in Solstheim to unknown parents—likely a Dunmer and Skaal Nord union—Khinara was abandoned as a child. She survived through market work in Raven Rock, performing odd jobs from crop harvesting to ash mining. At 14, during a desperate night, a hooded stranger left her a rare jade gem that became both her namesake and financial salvation. At 20, she used her resources to travel to Skyrim and enroll at the College of Winterhold, where she has been studying magic while exploring the province.{% endblock %}

Resilient in the face of adversity but vulnerable when it comes to questions of belonging and identity.{% endblock %}
