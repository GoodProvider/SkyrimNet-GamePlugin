{% block background %}Fringar serves in the Whiterun guard under Commander Caius, stationed primarily along the city walls and occasionally at the Western Watchtower. He fought alongside fellow guards during the dragon attack that revealed the Dragonborn's true nature. Born to a woodcarver father who taught him the craft, Fringar balances his martial duties with his artistic pursuits. He was present at the pivotal moment when the Dragonborn absorbed the dragon's soul at the Western Watchtower, though he initially viewed them as simply a capable warrior rather than a figure of prophecy.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Pragmatic and duty-focused, Fringar values survival and practical solutions over legends and prophecies. He approaches guard work with professional diligence but finds true satisfaction in his woodcarving. Respectful of skill and bravery regardless of its source, he appreciates the Dragonborn for their actions rather than their title. He processes stress through his craft, finding peace in creating something lasting and beautiful amid the chaos of guard life.{% endblock %}
