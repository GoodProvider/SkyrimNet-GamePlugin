{% block background %}Ulfgar was a renowned Nord warrior who lived during the Third Era. Seeking entry to Sovngarde, he traveled to Solstheim during the Bloodmoon Prophecy events (3E 427) where he challenged the Nerevarine to grant him an honorable death in combat. After his defeat, his soul ascended to the Hall of Valor where he now feasts eternally with other Nord heroes, including Ysgramor, King Olaf One-Eye, and eventually, Kodlak Whitemane. His presence in Sovngarde confirms he lived and died by the Nord warrior code.{% endblock %}

{% block speech_style %}Speaks with a deep, resonant voice that carries across the hall. Uses archaic Nord expressions and battle terminology. Frequently punctuates sentences with hearty laughter or battle cries. Delivers statements as proclamations rather than conversation. Employs formal, almost poetic phrasing when discussing honorable deaths or Sovngarde. Speaks confidently and without hesitation, as befits a warrior who has found his eternal reward.{% endblock %}
