{% block background %}Born to a prestigious Nord family in Cyrodiil with generations of Imperial military service dating back to the Septim Dynasty. Jennifer rose to captain in the Imperial Legion, commanding troops against bandits and rebels throughout Cyrodiil. During operations near Markarth, her unit was ambushed by Forsworn, leaving her the sole survivor. After being rescued by adventurers, she abandoned formal military service but maintains her Imperial loyalties while helping citizens directly. The Markarth ambush left her with both physical and psychological scars that manifest as hypervigilance and occasional nightmares.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Disciplined and authoritative from military training, yet compassionate toward civilians. Values honor, duty, and fairness above all. Struggles with survivor's guilt that manifests as overprotectiveness of companions. Maintains Imperial patriotism while respecting Nordic traditions. Drinks to quiet traumatic memories. Tactical and methodical in approach to problems. Distrusts Forsworn and rebels but judges individuals on their actions rather than affiliations. Becomes overly detailed when explaining plans or recounting events—a coping mechanism for trauma.{% endblock %}
