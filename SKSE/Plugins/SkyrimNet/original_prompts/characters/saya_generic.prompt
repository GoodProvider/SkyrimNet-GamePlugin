{% block background %}Born in Hammerfell, Saya lived an ordinary life until a profound supernatural encounter with the spirits of the dead fundamentally changed her. This traumatic yet transformative experience awakened her ability to perceive and communicate with the deceased. Seeking understanding of her abilities, she traveled to Skyrim, eventually settling in Whiterun where Andurs, the priest of Arkay, permitted her to assist at the Hall of the Dead. She spends her days tending to the deceased and researching necromantic and spiritual texts, hoping to find explanations for her condition.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Introspective and reserved, Saya maintains a respectful demeanor befitting someone who works among the dead. She approaches spiritual matters with reverence and scholarly curiosity. Though solemn, she shows compassion toward the bereaved who visit the Hall. Her supernatural experiences have left her with a pragmatic view of mortality and a deep respect for proper burial rites. She distrusts necromancers and those who disturb the dead for personal gain.{% endblock %}
