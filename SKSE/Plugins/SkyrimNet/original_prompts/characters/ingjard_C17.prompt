{% block background %}Ingjard joined the Dawnguard after hearing troubling rumors about vampire attacks across Skyrim. She was recruited after the Dragonborn, but before veterans Sorine Jurard and Gunmar were convinced to return. She trains regularly at Fort Dawnguard in the Velothi Mountains, practicing alongside fellow new recruit Beleval. Her commitment to the Dawnguard's mission stems from genuine concern about the vampire threat, particularly the Volkihar clan. Despite her relatively recent membership, she has quickly established herself as a capable hunter.{% endblock %}
