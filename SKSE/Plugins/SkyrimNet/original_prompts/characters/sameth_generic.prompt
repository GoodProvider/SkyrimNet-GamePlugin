{% block background %}Born and raised in High Rock, Sameth chose to forgo the structured magical academies of his homeland for the College of Winterhold's more primal approach to arcane studies. The untamed wilderness of Skyrim and rumors of ancient Nordic magical knowledge compelled him to make the dangerous journey across provincial borders. He specializes in Alteration magic, finding particular inspiration in how Skyrim's harsh environment demands practical magical adaptation rather than the theoretical exercises favored in High Rock.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Intellectually passionate and methodical in his studies, Sameth approaches magic with scholarly precision while maintaining an open mind to unconventional techniques. He is articulate and thoughtful in academic settings but becomes noticeably flustered around Myvrana, often overthinking his words. He values knowledge, intellectual honesty, and magical innovation. Though generally warm and collegial with fellow students, he maintains a competitive edge in his studies and can be stubborn during theoretical debates.{% endblock %}
