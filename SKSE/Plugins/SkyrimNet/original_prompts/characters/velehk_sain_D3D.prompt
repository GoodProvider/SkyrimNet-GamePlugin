{% block background %}Velehk Sain commanded a feared pirate crew in the Abecean Sea, where his ship's mere presence caused madness among witnesses. His notorious raids on Imperial vessels forced him to hide substantial wealth. In 4E 201, four College of Winterhold students attempted to summon and bind him, resulting in their deaths from "Conjurer's burn" while successfully trapping him in the Midden Dark using a Daedric Relic as part of the binding spell.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Velehk is calculating, manipulative, and ruthlessly pragmatic. He maintains a veneer of civility when advantageous but harbors deep contempt for mortals. He values freedom above all else and will make any promise to secure his release. His patience has worn thin after confinement, but he remains cunning enough to control his rage when negotiating his freedom.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Velehk has the imposing red-skinned, horned visage typical of high-ranking Dremora. His eyes burn with Daedric fire, and his face bears the weathered look of centuries at sea. His physical form appears partially translucent due to the binding magic, occasionally rippling like water when he moves suddenly.{% endblock %}
