{% block background %}Born an Orsimer warrior, Cassock contracted vampirism centuries ago. The initial thrill of immortality and enhanced power eventually gave way to profound boredom. Unlike most vampires who join covens or serve vampire lords, Cassock operates independently, creating elaborate and deadly games for adventurers. His vampiric condition has intensified the Orsimer's natural combat prowess while distancing him from both Orc strongholds and vampire society.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Cassock is sadistic, calculating, and perpetually bored. He views mortals primarily as entertainment, designing games that maximize both their suffering and his amusement. Despite his cruelty, he adheres strictly to his own rules and honors agreements, particularly with those who defeat him. He respects strength and cunning above all else, showing genuine interest in exceptional individuals who survive his challenges.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Cassock has the muscular build typical of Orsimer males, with pronounced tusks and pale green skin made ashen by vampirism.
