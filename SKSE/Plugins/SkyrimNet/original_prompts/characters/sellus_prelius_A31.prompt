{% block summary %}Sellus Prelius is a retired Imperial Legionnaire living in Bruma, Cyrodiil. He's a devout worshiper of the Divines, a proud Imperial citizen, and a concerned father and grandfather who disapproves of his Nord son-in-law's questionable loyalty to the Empire.{% endblock %}

{% block background %}Sellus served honorably in the Imperial Legion before retiring to Bruma. His daughter Lassinia married a Nord named Harran who also joined the Legion but has been missing for months. Sellus harbors suspicions about Harran's true loyalties, believing his son-in-law's heart belongs more to Skyrim than the Empire. He maintains connections at Castle Bruma's court, suggesting he held a position of some respect during his service. The Great War and subsequent White-Gold Concordat likely shaped his steadfast Imperial patriotism and religious devotion, as Bruma's proximity to Skyrim makes it a crossroads for political tensions.{% endblock %}
