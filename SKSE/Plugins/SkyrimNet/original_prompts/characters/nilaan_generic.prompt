{% block background %}Born to a modest Altmer family in Alinor, Nilaan rejected the political machinations and superiority complex common among her people. She left Summerset Isle before the Great War, distancing herself from Thalmor ideology. Her travels eventually brought her to Skyrim, where she found unexpected peace in the harsh landscape. She chose Ivarstead specifically for its proximity to High Hrothgar, drawn to the philosophical teachings of the Way of the Voice without formally joining the Greybeards.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Introspective, patient, and observant. Nilaan values wisdom over power, contemplation over action. She maintains emotional distance from most people but shows genuine interest in thoughtful conversation. She harbors mild disappointment toward fellow Altmer who embrace Thalmor supremacy. Her tranquility masks a deep curiosity about Nordic traditions and the Thu'um, which she studies from afar with scholarly detachment.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Tall and slender with the golden skin and high cheekbones typical of Altmer. Her eyes are an unusual pale amber, often distant in contemplation.
