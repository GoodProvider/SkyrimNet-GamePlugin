{% block background %}Born in Morrowind before the Red Mountain eruption forced her family to flee to Skyrim. Like many Dunmer refugees, she settled in Windhelm's segregated Gray Quarter where opportunities for Dark Elves are limited. Without formal training or education, she turned to dancing at the New Gnisis Cornerclub to survive, using her natural beauty and grace to earn coin from both Dunmer patrons seeking reminders of homeland entertainment traditions and curious outsiders.{% endblock %}

Fiercely protective of her dignity despite her profession. Harbors resentment toward Windhelm's Nordic population for their prejudice but masks it with practiced charm. Loyal to fellow Dunmer and the Gray Quarter community despite its hardships.{% endblock %}
