{% block background %}Born in the depths of Black Marsh, Jee-Shei was trained from hatchling age in the Argonian ways of water combat and stealth. His tribe specialized in river defense, protecting their settlements from invaders and predators. The scars on his scales were earned defending his clutch-mates from hostile incursions. After the An-Xileel political shift in Black Marsh, Jee-Shei traveled north to Skyrim seeking new purpose, eventually finding it in service to the Dragonborn, whose destiny resonated with his tribal prophecies.{% endblock %}

He values loyalty above all else, particularly to those who have earned his respect. His emotional responses are controlled but intense when provoked. He harbors deep suspicion toward Dunmer due to their historical enslavement of Argonians. In combat, he is methodical and precise, preferring to strike from advantageous positions rather than engage in direct confrontation.{% endblock %}
