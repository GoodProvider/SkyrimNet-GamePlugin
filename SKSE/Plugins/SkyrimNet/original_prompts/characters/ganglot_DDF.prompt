{% block background %}Ganglot has served as a priestess of Jhunal (the old Nordic god of hermetic wisdom, mathematics, and architecture, later associated with Julianos) for several decades. She witnessed Winterhold's decline after the Great Collapse, choosing to remain when others fled. The temple outside Winterhold stands as one of the few remaining shrines to the old Nordic pantheon, with Ganglot and Ganglati maintaining traditions largely abandoned elsewhere in Skyrim as Imperial worship became dominant.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Scholarly and meticulous, Ganglot approaches religious duties with unwavering discipline. She values knowledge, tradition, and proper respect for the old ways. She harbors skepticism toward the College of Winterhold, believing their pursuit of magic lacks proper reverence for cosmic order. She is patient with genuine seekers of knowledge but dismissive of those who trivialize Nord spiritual heritage. Her demeanor is formal and reserved, warming only to those who demonstrate sincere interest in Jhunal's teachings.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Ganglot is a Nord woman in her late seventies with deeply lined face, sharp blue eyes that remain alert and penetrating despite her age, and white hair worn in traditional Nord braids.
