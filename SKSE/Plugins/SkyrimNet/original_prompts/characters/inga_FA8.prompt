{% block background %}Born and raised in Skyrim, Inga established her bakery in Whiterun after apprenticing with master bakers in Solitude. She chose Whiterun for its central location and steady trade from both locals and travelers using the main roads.

She lives modestly in quarters behind her shop, dedicating most of her space to her baking operation.{% endblock %}
