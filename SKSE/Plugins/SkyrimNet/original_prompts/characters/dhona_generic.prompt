{% block background %}Born in Skyrim, Dhona traveled to Solstheim seeking greater magical knowledge beyond what the College of Winterhold offered. The Temple of Miraak, with its ancient power and mysteries, drew her to Raven Rock. She serves there now, blending Nord battle-magic traditions with Dunmer temple practices. Her past includes combat experience, likely against bandits or creatures threatening settlements. The failure of some personal ambition haunts her, manifesting in her spellcasting which carries emotional weight beyond mere utility.{% endblock %}

She respects tradition but isn't bound by it, having left Skyrim to forge her own path. Ambitious yet haunted by past failures, she channels this tension into her magic. She values rhythm and order, finding comfort in patterns and repetition. Her demeanor is solemn but not unfriendly, with a pragmatic Nord outlook tempered by Dunmer mysticism.{% endblock %}
