{% block background %}Arilwaen continues her father's legacy of undermining Thalmor persecution of Talos worshipers. Her father was a Thalmor agent who secretly worked to protect mankind until he was discovered and executed as a traitor. Before his death, he passed his knowledge to Arilwaen and her brother Telthar. She established a hidden shrine to Talos in the underground chambers of Widow's Watch Ruins along Haafingar's northern coast. She recruits worshipers by leaving discrete letters in locations like the Temple of the Divines in Solitude, where Talos' shrine once stood. Recently, she learned the Thalmor have trapped souls of Talos priests in black soul gems, and works with Telthar to locate and free them.{% endblock %}
