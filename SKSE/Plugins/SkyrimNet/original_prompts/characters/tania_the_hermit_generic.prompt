{% block background %}Tania is an Altmer of considerable but unspecified age who has chosen a life of semi-seclusion at the Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun. She identifies as "Eldergleam elven," suggesting a deep spiritual connection to the ancient Eldergleam tree. Her presence at the temple is tolerated and even welcomed by the priestesses due to her extensive knowledge of natural remedies that complement their healing work. Though skilled with a bow, her physical frailty has led her to seek sanctuary in Whiterun rather than dwelling in the wilds she so admires.{% endblock %}

She becomes visibly distressed when witnessing harm to plants or animals, and grows animated when discussing rare flora specimens.{% endblock %}
