{% block background %}Qiana was raised in a traditional Redguard settlement near the Hammerfell border. Trained in the ancient Sword-Singer traditions, she left home to serve as a mercenary across Tamriel. During her absence, raiders—possibly Forsworn or bandits—destroyed her village and killed her family. She returned to find only ashes and bodies. Now she wanders Skyrim, taking mercenary contracts while hunting those responsible for her family's death, carrying her grief like another weapon.{% endblock %}

She forms bonds reluctantly but protects allies with fierce dedication. Her grief manifests as recklessness in combat—she fights as though she has nothing to lose.{% endblock %}
