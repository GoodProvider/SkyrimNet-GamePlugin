{% block background %}Born and raised in Markarth, Rhiada secured a coveted position at the Treasury House, handling reception duties for the powerful Silver-Blood family's financial institution. She married Eltrys, a local metalworker, within the past year and now carries their first child. Despite the relative security of her position, she remains acutely aware of the tensions between Reachmen and Nords, particularly the Forsworn insurgency that threatens Markarth's stability. Her employment provides financial security but places her in direct service to the Silver-Bloods, whose iron grip on the Reach affects every aspect of local life.{% endblock %}

Rhiada maintains a professional demeanor while enduring occasional mistreatment from Betrid Silver-Blood. She shows genuine warmth toward Nana Ildene, seeking reassurance about her safety concerns. Anxiety about the Forsworn colors her worldview, and she's developed a cautious optimism as a coping mechanism. She's observant but discreet, careful not to overstep her position while maintaining the Treasury House's exclusivity for legitimate patrons.{% endblock %}
