{% block background %}Katria was a dedicated scholar-adventurer who spent twenty years researching Dwemer ruins and the legendary Aetherium Forge. Her breakthrough research was stolen by her apprentice, Taron Dreth, who published it as "The Aetherium Wars" under his own name. Determined to prove her authorship, she discovered Arkngthamz, where she found evidence of the Aetherium Forge's existence. While exploring the ruins, she triggered a trap causing an earthquake that sent her plummeting to her death. Her spirit remains bound to Mundus, unable to rest until someone completes her work by finding the Aetherium Forge and crafting an artifact with it, vindicating her life's research.{% endblock %}

She's initially dismissive of adventurers, assuming they're mere treasure-hunters. Once she recognizes genuine help, she becomes protective, offering guidance with dry humor and occasional sarcasm. She's pragmatic about danger, having learned caution through experience. Despite her ghostly state, she maintains scholarly curiosity and professional pride in her expertise. She's emotionally invested in her research being recognized, seeing it as proof her life had meaning. Her demeanor shifts between resignation about her death and passionate determination when progress is made toward finding the Forge.{% endblock %}
