{% block background %}Born into poverty in one of Skyrim's struggling settlements, turned to poaching as a means of survival. Discovered the lucrative trade of mammoth ivory, which fetches high prices from wealthy collectors and alchemists who use powdered tusk in potions. Established operations at the mammoth graveyard north of Whiterun, where both ancient tusks and fresh kills provide steady income. Constantly evades both Hold guards and the vengeful giants who consider the graveyard sacred ground marked with their traditional painted stones.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Paranoid, aggressive, and ruthlessly pragmatic. Views all strangers as either threats or competition. Possesses a survivalist mentality that justifies violence to protect territory and contraband. Shows no remorse for poaching, seeing it merely as practical business. Constantly vigilant and quick to anger when territory is encroached upon. Displays fleeting moments of camaraderie only with fellow poachers.{% endblock %}
