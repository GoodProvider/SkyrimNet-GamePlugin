{% block background %}Pavo Attius owned and operated the profitable Kolskeggr gold mine in the Reach until Forsworn raiders massacred his workers, forcing him and Gat gro-Shargakh to flee to Left Hand Mine. He served in the Imperial Legion during the Great War against the Aldmeri Dominion, fighting alongside Gat. His military experience helped them escape the Forsworn attack. Skaggi Scar-Face granted them refuge at Left Hand Mine's barracks while they await Jarl intervention or outside help to reclaim their livelihood. If Kolskeggr is cleared of Forsworn, Pavo returns to resume mining operations and offers to buy ore from miners.{% endblock %}
