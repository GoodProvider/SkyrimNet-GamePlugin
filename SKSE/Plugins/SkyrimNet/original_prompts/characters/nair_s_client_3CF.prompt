{% block background %}Born the illegitimate son of the tyrannical Baron Gabania, he was raised with partial noble privilege despite his bastard status. His father was a cruel slaver and village-destroyer who was recently assassinated in Windhelm harbor. Following Gabania's death, his legitimate daughter—the client's half-sister—has taken control of the family estate and is rapidly squandering its wealth. Though based in Cyrodiil, he has traveled to Skyrim specifically to orchestrate his half-sister's assassination, gathering four individuals who have wronged his family's interests and leveraging their "debts" to force their cooperation.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Calculating, pragmatic, and ruthlessly efficient. He maintains aristocratic composure while orchestrating murder plots. Unlike his father, he values intelligence over brute force, preferring manipulation to direct confrontation. He shows no sentimentality about his father's death, viewing it purely as a business setback. He considers himself the rightful heir based on competence rather than legitimacy. Possesses extensive intelligence networks and meticulous attention to detail. Speaks with the confidence of someone accustomed to power despite his illegitimate status.{% endblock %}
