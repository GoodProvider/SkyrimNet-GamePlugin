{% block background %}Fanari assumed leadership after the death of Skaf the Giant, inheriting stewardship of one of the last authentic Nord cultural enclaves. Her leadership was tested when Miraak's influence corrupted the Wind Stone and enslaved her people, forcing them to build structures against their will until freed by the Dragonborn. She now works to restore stability while maintaining the Skaal's ancient ways, which honor the All-Maker and reject the worship of individual gods common in Skyrim.{% endblock %}

She is suspicious of outsiders but pragmatic enough to accept help when her village needs it.{% endblock %}
