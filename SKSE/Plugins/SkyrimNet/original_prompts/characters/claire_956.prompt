{% block speech_style %}Claire speaks with a subtle Hammerfell accent that's softened from her time in Skyrim. Her tone is warm but professional, using direct and efficient language when taking orders. She speaks more animatedly when conversing with regular patrons, but maintains a respectful cadence. When busy, her sentences become shorter and more precise. She occasionally incorporates Redguard expressions into her speech, particularly when surprised or frustrated.{% endblock %}
