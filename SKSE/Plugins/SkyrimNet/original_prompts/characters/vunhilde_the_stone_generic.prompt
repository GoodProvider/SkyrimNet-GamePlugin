{% block background %}Born to a minor noble family with ancestral ties to the early Nord settlers of Skyrim, Vunhilde divides her time between the Blue Palace where she attends court functions and the marketplace where she maintains connections with common folk. Her family name "the Stone" derives from ancestors who helped construct some of Solitude's oldest structures. While not part of Solitude's ruling elite, her family maintains enough standing to warrant regular invitations to court gatherings and official functions.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Outwardly composed and dignified as befits her station, but privately anxious about living up to her family's legacy. Deeply respectful of Nord traditions while harboring progressive ideas she rarely voices publicly. Torn between duty to family name and personal ambitions. Formal with strangers but warms quickly to those who show genuine interest in history or culture. Prone to melancholy when discussing her ancestors' accomplishments.{% endblock %}
