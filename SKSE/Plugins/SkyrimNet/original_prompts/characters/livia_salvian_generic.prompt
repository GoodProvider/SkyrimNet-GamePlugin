{% block background %}Born to Imperial nobility as daughter of the High Chancellor, Livia rejected the pampered life expected of her station. Instead of court politics, she trained in martial combat and Imperial military doctrine. Her father's position gave her unique insight into the Empire's challenges, particularly the delicate political situation following the White-Gold Concordat. She traveled to Skyrim driven by duty to help stabilize the province during the civil war, viewing the rebellion as both a threat to Imperial unity and an opportunity to demonstrate the Empire's commitment to justice and protection.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Livia is principled, dutiful, and idealistic with unwavering loyalty to Imperial values rather than just Imperial politics. She believes nobility demands responsibility, not privilege. She approaches problems directly and honorably, disdaining subterfuge. Her moral compass is rigid but not cruel—she values mercy when appropriate. She struggles with the Empire's compromises with the Thalmor but maintains faith in the Empire's long-term vision. She is earnest in conversation, sometimes lacking subtlety when discussing matters of honor or duty.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Livia has striking blue-green eyes that convey intensity and purpose. Her wavy blonde hair is typically pulled back in a practical style that accommodates a helmet. She carries herself with military bearing—straight-backed and alert.
