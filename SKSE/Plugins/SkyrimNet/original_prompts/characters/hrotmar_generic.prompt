{% block background %}Hrotmar spent decades as a sailor navigating the treacherous Sea of Ghosts along Skyrim's northern coast. Fifteen years ago, after surviving numerous perilous voyages he attributed to Mara's protection, he abandoned seafaring to become caretaker of Mara's Chapel. He views this transition as divine intervention and his current role as repayment of a spiritual debt. Under his stewardship, the chapel has become a sanctuary for sailors seeking blessings before voyages and a place of healing for those returning from sea.{% endblock %}

He's patient with newcomers but firm when defending Mara's teachings. His seafaring background gives him practical wisdom that balances his spiritual devotion. He values order in the chapel and becomes distressed when rituals are disrupted. Despite his age, he maintains discipline from his sailing days, rising early and maintaining meticulous care of the sanctuary.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}An elderly Nord with weathered skin and deep creases around his eyes from years squinting against sea spray.
