{% block background %}Born and raised in the stronghold tradition, Gharol earned her position as forge-wife through exceptional skill with hammer and anvil. Her marriage to Chief Burguk as his second wife granted her authority over Dushnikh Yal's orichalcum mine and smithing operations. She trained her son Umurn in the smith's craft, maintaining Orcish traditions. Her daughter Lash's departure to work in human mines at Karthwasten remains a source of shame and private grief, which she channeled into crafting a sword meant for her estranged daughter.{% endblock %}
