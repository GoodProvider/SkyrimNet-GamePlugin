She maintains a network of hidden caches and observation points throughout the ashlands.{% endblock %}

She values self-reliance and tactical thinking above all else. Distrustful of strangers until they prove their worth. Respects competence and preparation while despising carelessness. Maintains emotional distance as a survival strategy, though occasionally reveals dry humor when comfortable.{% endblock %}
