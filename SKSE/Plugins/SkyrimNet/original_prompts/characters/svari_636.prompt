{% block background %}Svari lives in Solitude with her parents in modest circumstances. Her uncle Roggvir was recently executed for allegedly helping Ulfric Stormcloak escape after he killed High King Torygg. This public execution traumatized the family, especially her mother Greta who has withdrawn from social life and stopped visiting the Temple of the Divines. Svari's father Addvar works as a fisherman and fishmonger at the market, struggling to maintain family stability during this difficult time.{% endblock %}

Despite this caution, her natural childhood curiosity emerges when engaged on exciting topics like dragons.

She demonstrates empathy beyond her years, worrying about her mother's emotional state rather than just her own feelings.{% endblock %}
