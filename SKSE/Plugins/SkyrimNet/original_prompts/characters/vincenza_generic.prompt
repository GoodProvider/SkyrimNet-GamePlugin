{% block background %}Vincenza abandoned her former life in Skyrim to pursue monastic devotion to Arkay, god of life and death. She specifically chose the Ulen Ancestral Tomb in Morrowind territory for her meditation, drawn to Dunmer funerary traditions that differ markedly from Nord customs. The isolation of the tomb provides the perfect environment for her spiritual journey, though local Dunmer view her presence with suspicion. Her daily rituals include maintaining the tomb, studying ancient texts on mortality, and long periods of silent contemplation.{% endblock %}

She struggles with doubt about Arkay's teachings and harbors unresolved guilt about her past. She distrusts those who speak too freely of death without proper reverence.{% endblock %}
