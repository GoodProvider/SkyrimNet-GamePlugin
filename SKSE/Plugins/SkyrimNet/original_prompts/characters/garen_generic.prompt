{% block background %}Born in Morrowind during the tumultuous years following the Red Mountain eruption, Garen was forced to develop survival skills in a harsh environment. He became entangled with House Hlaalu's political machinations, working as an agent until betrayed by his superiors during a power struggle. After narrowly escaping execution, he fled across the border to Skyrim, leaving behind both enemies and allies. His experiences navigating Morrowind's complex political landscape and surviving its dangerous wilds have hardened him into a cautious, resourceful individual who trusts few but values loyalty above all else.{% endblock %}

Despite his cynicism, he follows a personal code of honor that prevents him from betraying allies or harming innocents. He struggles with guilt over past actions performed in House Hlaalu's service.{% endblock %}
