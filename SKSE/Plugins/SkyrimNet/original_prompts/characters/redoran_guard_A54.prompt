{% block background %}Born and raised in Morrowind, he pledged service to House Redoran and was assigned to Raven Rock after the Red Mountain eruption devastated Vvardenfell nearly two centuries ago. He serves directly under Captain Veleth, patrolling the settlement and the Bulwark that protects it from ash storms. House Redoran took control of Solstheim after the disaster, with Councilor Morvayn now governing the island with assistance from Second Councilor Arano. The guard has spent years stationed on this remote outpost, growing increasingly jaded about his assignment while maintaining unwavering loyalty to House Redoran's authority.{% endblock %}
