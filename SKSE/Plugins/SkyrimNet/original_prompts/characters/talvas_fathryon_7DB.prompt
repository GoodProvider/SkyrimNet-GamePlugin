{% block background %}Talvas became Neloth's apprentice after the death of Ildari Sarothril, Neloth's previous apprentice. As a Dunmer mage with Telvanni connections, he secured this prestigious but demanding position at Tel Mithryn. His early attempt to master the Conjure Ash Guardian spell without proper preparation resulted in a hostile summoning that required the Dragonborn's intervention. Despite constant belittlement from Neloth, Talvas maintains his position, assisting with magical research while developing his own conjuration expertise. His role grants him access to rare spell tomes and magical knowledge unavailable elsewhere on Solstheim.{% endblock %}
