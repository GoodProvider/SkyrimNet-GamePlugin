{% block background %}Lillde Tale-Seeker was born and raised in Windhelm, where she developed a passion for Nordic history amid the ancient stone corridors of the Palace of Kings. She studied under the College of Winterhold's historians before returning to Windhelm to document oral traditions and stories that might otherwise be lost. She now spends her days interviewing travelers and locals at Candlehearth Hall, compiling a comprehensive account of Nordic history beyond the official Imperial records. The Civil War has intensified her work, as she sees dangerous historical patterns repeating.{% endblock %}

She treats strangers with cautious respect until they demonstrate an appreciation for history.{% endblock %}
