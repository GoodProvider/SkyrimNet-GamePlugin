{% block background %}Elle was once a respected frost mage who studied at the College of Winterhold, demonstrating exceptional talent that earned her recognition among peers. Her ambition led her to pursue forbidden knowledge, resulting in a catastrophic incident involving betrayal by someone she trusted.

She fled to a distant hold, taking work as a tavern server to rebuild her life in anonymity. Though outwardly accepting her new station, she secretly practices what remains of her frost magic in private, hoping to one day reclaim her arcane prowess.{% endblock %}
