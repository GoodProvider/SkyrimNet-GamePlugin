{% block speech_style %}Speaks with cold, aristocratic precision. Uses archaic, formal language with elongated vowels and deliberate pacing. Voice carries unnatural resonance that unsettles listeners. Frequently pauses mid-sentence when discussing blood or hunting, as if distracted by hunger. Refers to mortals with dismissive terms like "cattle" or "prey." Occasionally slips into predatory hissing when angered or hungry.{% endblock %}
