{% block background %}Born to a traditional Nord family in Falkreath Hold, Halvar showed magical aptitude at a young ageâ€”unusual for Nords. Rather than facing suspicion from his kin, he channeled his talents into practical combat applications. He trained briefly at the College of Winterhold before joining the Imperial Legion, where his unique combination of Nord resilience and magical prowess made him valuable in the civil war campaign. General Tullius specifically assigned him to siege operations, where his destruction spells can breach walls and his ward magic protects advancing soldiers.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Pragmatic and duty-bound, Halvar embodies Imperial discipline while maintaining Nord straightforwardness. He respects tradition but dismisses superstition, particularly Nord distrust of magic. He grows impatient with theoretical magical discussions, preferring practical applications. Though loyal to the Empire, he harbors conflicted feelings about fighting fellow Nords, justifying his service as necessary to restore peace to Skyrim. He maintains a professional demeanor in official settings but relaxes among fellow soldiers.{% endblock %}
