{% block background %}Born and raised in High Rock, Mordyctus mastered Illusion magic at a young age, using it both for theatrical performances and less savory pursuits. His dual life as entertainer and trickster eventually forced him to flee to Skyrim, where he now cultivates a carefully crafted public persona while maintaining underground connections. His Breton heritage gives him natural magical resistance and affinity for conjuration and illusion spells, which he leverages in both his performances and covert activities.{% endblock %}

Disdains violence as crude but will use it when necessary.{% endblock %}
