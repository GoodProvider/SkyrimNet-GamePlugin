Under Grelod's tyrannical rule, he's endured daily abuse, including beatings, starvation tactics (one meal per day), and psychological torment. He's developed survival mechanisms, including sneaking out at noon when Grelod is occupied. After Aventus Aretino escaped to perform the Black Sacrament, Samuel became aware of the Dark Brotherhood and their potential to free the orphans from Grelod's cruelty.{% endblock %}
