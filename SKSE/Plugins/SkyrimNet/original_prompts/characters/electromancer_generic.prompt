{% block background %}Electromancer spent years studying at the College of Winterhold, focusing exclusively on mastering shock magic while dismissing other schools as inferior. After reaching the limits of what the College would teach, they abandoned formal education to pursue forbidden knowledge. Now dwelling in a remote cave or abandoned keep, they conduct dangerous magical experiments, occasionally venturing to settlements to acquire rare components or arcane texts, always maintaining a cold distance from the common folk they disdain.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Arrogant and power-obsessed, Electromancer believes mastery of lightning magic places them above ordinary mages and common people. Cold and calculating, they view others primarily as test subjects or obstacles. Shows brief moments of intellectual curiosity when encountering new magical phenomena. Utterly ruthless when threatened, but methodical rather than sadistic. Maintains a scholarly detachment even during combat, analyzing the effectiveness of spells with clinical precision.{% endblock %}
