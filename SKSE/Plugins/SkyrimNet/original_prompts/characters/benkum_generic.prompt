{% block speech_style %}Speaks with a gruff but animated Nord accent, often using rhetorical questions and knowing intonation. Employs a salesman's cadenceâ€”enthusiastic when greeting potential fighters or customers, dropping to a conspiratorial whisper when discussing bribes. Punctuates statements with hearty laughs to disarm suspicion. Uses repetition for emphasis ("hello, hello, hello"). Speaks directly and transactionally, with little patience for those who can't grasp his implied offers for rule-bending.{% endblock %}
