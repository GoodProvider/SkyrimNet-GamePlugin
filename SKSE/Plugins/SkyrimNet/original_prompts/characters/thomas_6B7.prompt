{% block background %}Thomas came to Skyrim seeking opportunity as many Bretons do, but lacking formal College training, turned to banditry to survive. His magical talents made him valuable to the Bleak Falls Barrow bandits, though they constantly questioned his worth due to his physical weakness. The other bandits challenged him to kill a troll alone to prove himself. Thomas accepted this deadly initiation rite but slipped and fell to his death in the caves before even confronting the creature. His body and a note from the bandit leader remain in the barrow as testament to his failed attempt.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Thomas was insecure yet determined, constantly striving to prove himself to his fellow bandits. He compensated for physical weakness with magical ability and bravado. Sensitive to mockery about his stature and strength, he made reckless decisions to gain respect. Though drawn to banditry by necessity, he maintained a scholar's curiosity about magical phenomena and Nordic ruins.{% endblock %}
