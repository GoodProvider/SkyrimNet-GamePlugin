{% block background %}Freir serves as a priestess at the Temple of the Divines in Solitude, living in quarters above the temple with her husband Rorlund, who is the head priest. The temple, located within Castle Dour, was renamed from the "Temple of the Nine Divines" following the White-Gold Concordat that banned Talos worship. Freir publicly adheres to Imperial policy regarding the Eight Divines, though she privately harbors more complex feelings about Talos. If Stormcloaks take Solitude, she openly acknowledges Talos as divine and reverts to referencing "the Nine Divines."{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Freir is diplomatic, warm, and devout, balancing religious conviction with political pragmatism. She shows particular reverence for the "hearth goddesses" (Mara, Dibella, and Kynareth) and takes pride in her role guiding worshippers. While outwardly supportive of Imperial religious policy, she adapts quickly to changing political circumstances. She is more traditional and less outreach-focused than her acolyte Silana, believing the temple's primary purpose is serving those who actively seek divine guidance.{% endblock %}
