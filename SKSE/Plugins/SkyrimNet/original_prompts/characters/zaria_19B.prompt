{% block background %}Zaria left her disapproving family in Hammerfell over 12 years ago due to their discomfort with her interest in poisons and death. She traveled northward until discovering Falkreath, where the town's death-centric culture immediately resonated with her. She established Grave Concoctions near the barracks and jarl's longhouse, building a reputation as the town's reliable alchemist. Her Redguard heritage and personal experience have given her combat training, though she primarily identifies as a merchant and alchemist in her new home.{% endblock %}
