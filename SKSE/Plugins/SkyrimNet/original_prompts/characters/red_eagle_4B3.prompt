{% block background %}Born in the Sundered Hills around 1E 1030, Red Eagle (Faolan) was prophesied to unite the ten warring kings of the Reach. When Empress Hestra's Alessian forces invaded in 1E 1055, the tribal elders exiled him for refusing to surrender. Forming a resistance, he made a pact with a Hagraven, sacrificing his heart to become a Briarheart. His forces liberated the Reach for two years before Hestra's return. Red Eagle died fighting alone against a thousand Imperials and was entombed in Rebel's Cairn with his legendary sword. He swore to rise again when his blade returned to his tomb and the Reach stood free.{% endblock %}
