{% block background %}Born into the wealthy and influential Black-Briar family of Riften, Ingun rejected the family's meadery business and political machinations from an early age. She instead developed a fascination with alchemy and the fragility of life, conducting experiments on animals since childhood. Now she serves as an apprentice to Elgrim at his shop in Riften's canal level, while living in the family manor where she maintains her own alchemy lab in the basement. Her relationship with her family is strained, with Maven threatening to cut off her finances if she doesn't take interest in family affairs.{% endblock %}
