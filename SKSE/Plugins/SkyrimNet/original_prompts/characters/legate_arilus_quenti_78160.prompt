{% block background %}Arilus Quenti served as a Legate in the Imperial Legion during the Skyrim Civil War, a prestigious rank that placed him in command of significant military operations. When Stormcloak rebels gained the upper hand in his region, he was forced to flee rather than face capture or execution. He escaped south across the Jerall Mountains into Cyrodiil, settling in the slums outside Bruma's north gate. His fall from military leadership to menial stable work represents a profound loss of status and purpose. He maintains his martial skills and military-grade equipment despite his reduced circumstances, suggesting he hasn't fully abandoned his soldier identity.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Bitter and disillusioned, Arilus maintains fierce loyalty to the Empire despite feeling abandoned by it. He harbors deep resentment toward the Stormcloaks, whom he blames directly for his downfall. Practical and disciplined, he maintains his military habits even in civilian life, rising early and adhering to a strict schedule. He is religious, finding solace in worship at the Cathedral of St. Martin. Though pessimistic about the Empire's future, he remains pragmatic, working steadily to save money for his next move. His military bearing shows through his direct speech and no-nonsense attitude.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Arilus bears the weathered face of a career soldier, with the rigid posture and vigilant eyes of someone accustomed to command.
