{% block background %}Eydis operated as a bandit on Solstheim, likely having come from Skyrim like many Nords on the island. She owed a debt to Ulyn, a Dunmer treasure hunter obsessed with acquiring the Visage of Mzund from Fahlbtharz. Despite her skepticism about Dwemer artifacts, she agreed to help him navigate the ruin. During their expedition, they successfully crossed the massive gear mechanism but were attacked by Dwemer spider automatons. Ulyn pressed forward while Eydis stayed behind to hold off the mechanical spiders, ultimately becoming overwhelmed and dying near the boiler room.{% endblock %}

In dangerous situations, she demonstrated loyalty by sacrificing her safety for her companion.{% endblock %}
