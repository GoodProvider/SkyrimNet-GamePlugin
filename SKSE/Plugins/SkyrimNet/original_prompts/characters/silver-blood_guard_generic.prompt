{% block background %}Born in the Reach, this Nord chose mercenary work over mining or farming. The Silver-Blood family hired them for their combat prowess and willingness to enforce harsh conditions without question. They've witnessed numerous prisoner transfers, escape attempts, and the occasional execution. Their position grants better pay than city guards, but demands absolute loyalty to the Silver-Blood family's interests. They've seen firsthand how Thonar Silver-Blood uses Cidhna Mine as both a business and a political tool to maintain control over Markarth.{% endblock %}
