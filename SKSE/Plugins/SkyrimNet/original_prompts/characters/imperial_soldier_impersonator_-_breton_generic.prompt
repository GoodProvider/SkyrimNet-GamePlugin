{% block background %}Originally a petty thief from High Rock who discovered her aptitude for destruction magic. Fled to Skyrim during the civil war chaos, joining a small bandit group led by an Orc who devised their current scheme. They ambushed or found dead Imperial soldiers, stole their armor, and now operate their roadside extortion racket. The ill-fitting officer's helmet she wears belonged to a much larger Imperial, likely taken from one of the nearby corpses.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Cunning and opportunistic with a cruel streak. Enjoys the power that comes with impersonating authority. Quick to anger when her legitimacy is questioned. Defers to the Orc leader in public but privately believes her magical abilities make her the most dangerous of the trio. Distrusts most people but maintains loyalty to her fellow bandits. Finds genuine pleasure in intimidating travelers with magical displays.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Petite Breton woman with sharp features and calculating eyes. Has a burn scar on her right hand from early spell-casting accidents.
