{% block background %}Born in Skyrim, Rilja spent her youth as an adventurer exploring Nordic ruins across the province, developing expertise in ancient Nordic metalwork and collecting artifacts. She eventually settled in Bruma, Cyrodiil's northernmost city with a significant Nord population, establishing herself as a specialized merchant. Though she lives in a humble shack in the slums outside the city walls, she has transformed it into a showcase of Nordic culture with furs, banners and decorations. Her decision to live in Cyrodiil stems from her desire to help Bruma's Nords maintain connection to their cultural roots beyond just the superficial similarities of snow and cold.{% endblock %}
