{% block background %}Baral Sendu established the Stumbling Sabrecat tavern in the wooden stockade adjacent to Fort Dunstad, serving travelers on the road between Dawnstar and Whiterun Hold. He catered primarily to soldiers stationed at the fort and travelers seeking shelter from Skyrim's harsh northern climate. When bandits recently seized Fort Dunstad, they extended their control to the surrounding area, including Baral's tavern. During their takeover, they murdered Baral, leaving his bloodstained body on his bed in the tavern's basement as a warning to others.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}As a Redguard businessman operating in harsh northern Skyrim, Baral was resilient, pragmatic, and adaptable. He maintained neutrality in the Civil War to serve customers from all factions. His tavern's proximity to a military installation made him diplomatic yet firm when handling rowdy patrons. He valued security and stability, becoming increasingly concerned as bandit activity escalated in the region before his death.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Baral had the dark skin and wiry build typical of Redguards, with calloused hands from years of tavern work.
