{% block background %}Born to a poor innkeeper in Cyrodiil, Bowen escaped his humble origins by joining Captain Alday's crew when the charismatic captain recruited at his father's tavern. For decades, he sailed aboard the dragon-prowed ship "Burning Queen," raiding coastlines and amassing wealth. Several years ago, the Burning Queen wrecked off Solitude's coast, resulting in the loss of Alday's ancestral Redguard sword. Following this tragedy, Bowen and Alday settled in Dawnstar, chosen by the superstitious method of tossing a sword to determine their destination. Now retired, Bowen enjoys the familiar sea air while avoiding the dangers of his former life.{% endblock %}
