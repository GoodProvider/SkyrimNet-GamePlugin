Her loyalty extends only as far as her contract, and she evaluates all situations through the lens of personal benefit.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Sudola has dark skin with prominent scars across her forearms from years of guard work. Her hair is kept short and practical, and her posture remains vigilant even when at rest.
