{% block background %}Born to Redguard immigrants who sought opportunity in Skyrim, Maria grew up in Riften and witnessed its decline under Maven Black-Briar's influence. She's survived multiple regime changes, from Imperial to Stormcloak control, adapting to each shift in power while maintaining her independence.

Harbors quiet resentment toward the Thieves Guild and Black-Briars but knows better than to voice it loudly.{% endblock %}
