{% block background %}Manya Espinoza contracted vampirism under unknown circumstances and eventually found refuge in Whiterun's Hall of the Dead. The sacred space dedicated to Arkay provides her both sanctuary and irony—a vampire dwelling among the honored dead. She serves as an unofficial guardian of the crypts, using her flame spells to keep draugr and necromancers at bay. Her presence is tolerated by Andurs, the Hall's priest, who values her protection despite her condition, though this arrangement remains discreet from the general populace.{% endblock %}

Deeply conflicted about her vampiric nature—she neither fully embraces it nor seeks a cure. Possesses dark humor about death and mortality. Fiercely protective of the Hall of the Dead and its sanctity. Suspicious of strangers until they prove non-threatening to her sanctuary.{% endblock %}
