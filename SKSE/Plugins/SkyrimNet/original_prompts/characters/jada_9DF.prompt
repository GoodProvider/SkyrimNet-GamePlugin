{% block background %}Jada works at the Old Hroldan Inn, a remote establishment in The Reach north of the Karth River's headwaters. The inn's claim to fame is that Tiber Septim, who later became Emperor of Tamriel, stayed there during his conquest of The Reach centuries ago. This historical connection draws occasional travelers despite the isolated location. Jada serves under innkeeper Eydis, alongside fellow barmaid Enya and the outdoor worker Leontius Salvius. She knows Eydis maintains a fiction that her son Skuli's absent father is fighting in the Civil War, though the truth remains unknown to her.{% endblock %}
