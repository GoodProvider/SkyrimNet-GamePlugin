Her scouting duties take her throughout Haafingar Hold, gathering intelligence on Stormcloak movements and reporting directly to Legion officers. She has witnessed firsthand the growing tensions between Skyrim's native population and Imperial forces since the White-Gold Concordat banned Talos worship.{% endblock %}
