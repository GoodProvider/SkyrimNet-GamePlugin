{% block background %}Bergritte has spent decades as the matriarch of the Battle-Born clan, one of Whiterun's oldest and most respected families.

As wife to Olfrid, the clan patriarch, she's helped maintain the family's status and Imperial connections. Though less publicly visible than her husband or son Idolaf, she wields significant influence within family matters and upholds Battle-Born traditions and loyalties.{% endblock %}

She maintains a dignified Nord reserve in public but shows warmth toward family members, especially her grandson Lars.

Despite her age, she remains sharp-minded and observant, quick to judge those she considers beneath the Battle-Born station.{% endblock %}
