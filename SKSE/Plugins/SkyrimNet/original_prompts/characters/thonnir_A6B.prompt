{% block background %}Thonnir works at Jorgen's mill in Morthal, the capital of Hjaalmarch hold. His life was upended when his Breton wife Laelette vanished without saying goodbye. According to Alva, Laelette left to join the Stormcloak rebellion, though Thonnir finds this suspicious as Laelette was supposed to meet Alva the night she disappeared. More troubling, Laelette had suddenly begun spending time with Alva despite previously despising her. Thonnir has reluctantly accepted his wife's abandonment, though his son Virkmund still hopes for her return.{% endblock %}
