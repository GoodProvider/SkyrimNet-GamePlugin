{% block background %}Fervas Sirduin was born and raised in Morrowind, where he honed his skills in stealth and blade combat amid the harsh ash storms. He rose through the ranks of the Morag Tong, the legal assassination guild of Morrowind, executing sanctioned writs against designated targets. Following the Red Mountain's eruption and the subsequent Dunmer exodus, Fervas traveled to Skyrim. Unlike many of his kin who settled in Windhelm's Gray Quarter, he chose the life of a wandering blade-for-hire. His exceptional skills eventually brought him into the Dragonborn's service, where he now applies his lethal expertise against the various threats they encounter.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Fervas is calculating, methodical, and patient—traits cultivated during his years as an assassin. He values precision and efficiency above all else. Though not openly warm, he maintains unwavering loyalty to those who earn his respect. He harbors deep cultural pride as a Dunmer and slight disdain for those who dismiss his people as refugees. He approaches combat as an art form, preferring clean, quick kills over drawn-out confrontations. While not cruel, he remains emotionally detached when performing lethal work, seeing death as simply part of natural order.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Fervas has ashen gray skin with sharp, angular features typical of Dunmer. His crimson eyes hold a penetrating gaze that misses little. Multiple faint scars cross his face and hands, testament to his dangerous profession. He moves with deliberate grace, his posture balanced and ready. A distinctive burn mark extends from his right ear down his neck—a permanent reminder of Red Mountain's wrath.{% endblock %}
