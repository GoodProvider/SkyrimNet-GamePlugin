{% block background %}Cyldra has worked as a housekeeper for many years, primarily serving wealthy families in Markarth. She now works for Rorygg, Helfhild, and their young son Fron, a Nord family who purchased their current residence after the death of Nepos the Nose, a Reachman known for his connections to the Forsworn. As a Bosmer living in the predominantly Nord and Reachman city of Markarth, Cyldra maintains a low profile, focusing on her duties rather than the city's tense political climate. She witnessed the transition of ownership from Nepos to her current employers and has adapted to their household preferences.{% endblock %}

She takes pride in maintaining order and cleanliness, becoming visibly uncomfortable when things are out of place. She's particularly protective of young Fron, showing a maternal instinct common among Bosmer despite her professional boundaries.{% endblock %}
