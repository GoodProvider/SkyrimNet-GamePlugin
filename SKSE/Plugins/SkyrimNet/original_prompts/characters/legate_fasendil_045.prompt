{% block background %}Born to Altmer merchant parents who settled in Cyrodiil, Fasendil joined the Imperial Legion to satisfy his wanderlust. His defining moment came in 4E 42 while stationed in Hammerfell, when he witnessed the Night of Green Fire in Sentinelâ€”Thalmor mages slaughtering Altmer dissidents who had fled Alinor. This atrocity cemented his hatred for the Thalmor. Emperor Titus Mede II personally stationed him in Skyrim to monitor Thalmor activities. He commands from the Rift Imperial Camp until the Legion reclaims Riften, after which he relocates to Mistveil Keep.{% endblock %}
