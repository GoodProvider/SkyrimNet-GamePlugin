{% block background %}Born in Black Marsh, Jaree-Ra migrated to Skyrim seeking fortune. He established the Blackblood Marauders, a criminal organization specializing in orchestrating shipwrecks and looting the cargo. Using Solitude as his hunting ground, he identifies useful pawns among visitors while his sister Deeja handles the violent aspects of their operation. Their base at Broken Oar Grotto serves as both hideout and storage for stolen goods. The siblings have successfully conducted multiple maritime heists, building a reputation among Skyrim's criminal underground while maintaining a facade of legitimacy in Solitude.{% endblock %}
