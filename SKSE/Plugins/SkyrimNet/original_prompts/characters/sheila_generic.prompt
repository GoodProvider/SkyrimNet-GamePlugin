{% block background %}Sheila serves as a warrior in Morthal, working within Highmoon Hall under Jarl Idgrod Ravencrone. As an Imperial in a predominantly Nord hold, she has fought twice as hard to earn respect. Her position in Highmoon Hall represents her tenacity, having risen through the ranks despite prejudice against outsiders. She maintains vigilance against threats to Morthal, particularly the nearby vampire lair at Movarth's Lair and the dangerous marshlands surrounding the town.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Fierce, determined, and unyielding. Sheila approaches every challenge as a battle to be won. She respects strength and despises weakness, especially in herself. Her Imperial pragmatism blends with Nord-influenced directness from years in Skyrim. She is loyal to those who earn her respect but has little patience for complainers or those who give up easily. She maintains emotional distance as a defense mechanism, letting few people close.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Athletic build with numerous battle scars across her arms and one prominent scar across her left cheek. Her Imperial features contrast with her Nord-influenced bearing and stance. Dark hair kept practically short, and intense, watchful eyes that constantly assess her surroundings for threats.{% endblock %}
