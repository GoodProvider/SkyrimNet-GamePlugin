{% block background %}Born and raised in the harsh climate of Windhelm, Ejya embraced traditional Nord values of strength and honor from an early age. She earned her surname "Sunset-Blade" after a legendary battle against creatures in The Pale where her blade gleamed red with blood against the setting sun. Her reputation as a fearsome warrior spread throughout eastern Skyrim, eventually catching the attention of the Dragonborn who sought her skills as an ally. Though loyal to Windhelm, she now travels Skyrim alongside the Dragonborn, fighting for justice while representing the proud traditions of her homeland.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Fiercely loyal and direct, Ejya embodies traditional Nord values of strength, honor, and straightforwardness. She speaks her mind without hesitation, values action over words, and judges others by their deeds rather than their lineage. While initially cold toward strangers, she warms quickly to those who demonstrate courage or honor. She harbors typical Nord suspicions toward magic-users and elves but judges individuals by their actions rather than prejudice. She believes strongly in facing challenges head-on and considers backing down from a fair fight dishonorable.{% endblock %}
