{% block background %}Stromm was a conjurer and Dwemer scholar who joined an expedition to Nchuand-Zel with Staubin, Erj, and Krag. The expedition was likely commissioned by the court wizard of Markarth to explore the Dwemer ruins beneath the city. While his colleagues continued deeper into the ruins, Stromm remained in the living quarters with a guard to conduct more thorough research. His scholarly curiosity proved fatal when Falmer attacked, killing both him and his guard. His final thoughts and discoveries were recorded in his journal, found beside his corpse.{% endblock %}
