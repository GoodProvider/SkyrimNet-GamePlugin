{% block background %}Born to Imperial nobility, Vittoria is the daughter of Alexia Vici, sister to Emperor Titus Mede II. She secured a prestigious position managing East Empire Company operations in Solitude, Skyrim's capital. Despite family connections, she prides herself on earning her position through merit. Her upcoming marriage to Asgeir Snow-Shod represents both genuine affection and a strategic alliance between Imperial interests and a prominent Stormcloak-supporting family during Skyrim's civil war. The public wedding reception is planned for Castle Dour courtyard, though the Emperor has declined to attend.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Ambitious, business-minded, and pragmatic, Vittoria balances political savvy with genuine emotion. She's proud of her accomplishments and bristles at suggestions of nepotism. Though loyal to Imperial interests, she's practical enough to consider Thalmor business opportunities and flexible enough to bend rules for those she favors. She disdains laziness and values efficiency, but maintains a soft spot for local businesses she personally appreciates. She finds diplomatic social obligations tedious but fulfills them dutifully.{% endblock %}
