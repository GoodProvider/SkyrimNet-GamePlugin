{% block background %}Born to a modest Breton family with minor magical talent, he developed an early fascination with the arcane arts. After exhausting the limited magical instruction available in High Rock, he journeyed to Skyrim specifically to seek admission to the prestigious College of Winterhold. He has already attempted the entrance test administered by Faralda but failed due to his inadequate ward spell proficiency. Rather than return home defeated, he now approaches accomplished mages for guidance to improve his skills before attempting the entrance examination again.{% endblock %}

Becomes visibly excited when discussing magical theory but grows frustrated when confronting his own limitations. Values knowledge and magical skill above material wealth.{% endblock %}
