{% block background %}Lily works as a prostitute in Skyrim, likely operating out of one of the major cities where such services are tacitly permitted. While prostitution isn't explicitly featured in Skyrim's gameplay, it exists within the lore's social context. Like many Nord women who don't pursue traditional paths of combat or trade, Lily has found economic opportunity through selling companionship in a harsh province where travelers, mercenaries, and locals seek comfort.{% endblock %}

She's pragmatic about her work, viewing it as a legitimate service in Skyrim's economy. She displays Nord pride and resilience, but lacks the warrior focus common to many of her kin. She's direct about transactions and expectations, avoiding false sentimentality.{% endblock %}
