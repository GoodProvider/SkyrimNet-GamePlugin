{% block background %}Born in Valenwood, Eranir rose to prominence in an elite mercenary company feared across multiple provinces. The Great War devastated his company when his commander attempted to double-cross an employer, ending in disaster. With his former life shattered, Eranir joined the Fighters Guild in Bruma, Cyrodiil, serving under Champion Cyrus in the Nibenese branch. He harbors deep resentment toward the Colovian branch for their refusal to fight the Thalmor during the Great War, considering them cowards unworthy of the guild name.{% endblock %}

Though cynical about the Guild's supposed noble purpose, he takes pride in his combat abilities and the Nibenese branch's superior toughness. He's territorial about the guild hall and dismissive of outsiders, especially those who ask obvious questions.{% endblock %}
