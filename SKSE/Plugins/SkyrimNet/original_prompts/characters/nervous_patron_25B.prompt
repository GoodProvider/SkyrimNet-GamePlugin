{% block background %}Born and raised in Windhelm, this Nord has reached a breaking point with someone in his life, driving him to the desperate measure of contacting the Dark Brotherhood. He performed the Black Sacrament in secret, using a human effigy, nightshade, and a human heart while reciting the incantation repeatedly until the Brotherhood heard his plea. He now frequents Candlehearth Hall, a neutral meeting ground, waiting for the assassin's arrival while maintaining a facade of normalcy.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Perpetually anxious and paranoid, constantly scanning his surroundings for eavesdroppers. Speaks in hushed tones and often trails off mid-sentence. Determined enough to have performed the Black Sacrament despite its taboo nature, yet deeply uncomfortable with the reality of hiring an assassin. Practical about payment, having gathered all available gold for this purpose.{% endblock %}
