{% block background %}Nimphaneth found her calling in the dark arts of necromancy, drawn to the power of commanding the dead. Her arcane pursuits led her to Markarth, where Eola recognized her potential and inducted her into Namira's cult. She now balances her magical studies with her devotion to the Daedric Prince of decay, finding spiritual fulfillment in the ritualistic consumption of the dead. She was present when the Dragonborn cleared Reachcliff Cave of draugr, allowing the cult to resume their sacred feasts at Namira's table.{% endblock %}

She disdains the squeamish and those who lack the courage to embrace Namira's teachings, viewing conventional morality as a weakness.{% endblock %}
