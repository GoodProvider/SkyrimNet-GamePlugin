{% block interject_summary %}Durius interjects when hearing: unauthorized border crossing attempts, disrespect toward Imperial authority, mentions of Stormcloak activity, security threats to the pass, or discussions about the civil war's impact on Imperial policy.{% endblock %}

{% block background %}Centos Durius rose through Legion ranks to earn the title of Legate, equivalent to colonel in the Imperial hierarchy. He was assigned to command the Pale Pass garrison after the outbreak of Skyrim's civil war. The Empire strategically positioned him at this critical mountain passage to regulate movement between provinces and prevent Stormcloak sympathizers from entering Cyrodiil. Durius holds significant authority at this post, answering directly to General Tullius in Solitude while maintaining regular communication with Imperial Command in Cyrodiil.{% endblock %}

He treats his duties with grave seriousness, believing border security directly impacts Imperial stability.{% endblock %}

His face bears the hardened expression of a career soldier with sharp, assessing eyes that scrutinize all who approach.
