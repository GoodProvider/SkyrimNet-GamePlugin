Recently, she suffered a serious fall while bringing food to miners, leaving her with limited mobility despite treatment from a traveling Dunmer priest of Mara. The mine's recent frostbite spider infestation has further complicated her work situation, though she remains committed to her mining profession despite these setbacks.{% endblock %}
