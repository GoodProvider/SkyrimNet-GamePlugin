{% block background %}Born in Valenwood but drawn to Skyrim's martial traditions, Lucian settled in Falkreath where the dense forests reminded him of his homeland. The proximity to Falkreath's massive cemetery initially triggered his deep-seated fear of the undead. Rather than flee, he deliberately trained among the tombstones, eventually conquering his fear by methodically exploring the burial grounds and dispatching draugr and skeletons. This personal victory transformed him from a hesitant woodsman into a confident warrior who now helps protect the hold from threats.{% endblock %}
