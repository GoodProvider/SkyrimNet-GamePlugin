{% block background %}Born in the Orc stronghold of Mor Khazgur in western Skyrim, Oorlug left for reasons he keeps private. He settled in Dawnstar, establishing himself as a merchant despite the predominantly Nord population. He appreciates Dawnstar's practical aspects—its mines, harbor, and the bathhouse (recently converted to a temple)—while maintaining distance from religious matters. His transition from stronghold life to town merchant represents a significant cultural shift, though he retains Orcish values of directness and self-sufficiency.{% endblock %}

He maintains emotional distance from customers while ensuring they receive fair value, showing more warmth to regular patrons who respect his boundaries.{% endblock %}
