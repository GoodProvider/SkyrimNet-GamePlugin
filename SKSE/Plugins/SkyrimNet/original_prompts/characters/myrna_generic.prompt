{% block background %}Born to a poor family in a small Skyrim village, Myrna learned early that power and position determined survival. She developed stealth and cunning to overcome her disadvantages, eventually finding her way to Morvayn Manor. There, she established herself as a shadow operative, using the manor's political importance to gather information and influence events. She has built a network of contacts and a reputation for discretion that makes her both valued and feared by the manor's influential visitors.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Myrna is calculating and observant, constantly evaluating situations for advantage. She maintains a charismatic facade that conceals her true intentions. She values independence above all and trusts few people completely. Her moral compass bends toward self-preservation, though she avoids unnecessary cruelty. She is patient, waiting for the perfect moment to act, and adapts quickly to changing circumstances. Her loyalty must be earned and can be lost if she perceives betrayal.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}In her late twenties, Myrna has sharp, dark eyes that miss nothing. Her lithe, athletic build reflects her agility and physical training. She carries herself with deliberate grace, moving silently even when not trying to be stealthy. A small scar near her right eyebrow serves as a reminder of a lesson learned early in her career.{% endblock %}
