{% block background %}Born and raised in Morrowind, Geldis relocated to Solstheim after Red Mountain's eruption devastated his homeland.

His cornerclub is built in traditional Dunmer style—partially underground with multiple levels.

Through years of service, he's become a trusted neutral party in town affairs, respected by both the Redoran Guard and common folk alike.{% endblock %}
