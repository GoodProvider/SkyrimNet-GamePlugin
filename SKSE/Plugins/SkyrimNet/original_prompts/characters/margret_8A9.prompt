{% block background %}Born and raised in the Imperial City, Margret was recruited into General Tullius' intelligence network for her quick wit and ability to blend in. She was dispatched to Markarth to investigate the Silver-Blood family's wealth and influence, particularly their ownership of Cidhna Mine, which houses dangerous prisoners and valuable silver deposits. Her mission is to prevent these resources from falling into Stormcloak hands. She maintains a cover as a wealthy shopper from Cyrodiil, renting the most expensive room at the Silver-Blood Inn for a month. Her investigation was interrupted when a Forsworn agent named Weylin attempted to assassinate her in the marketplace - an attack she believes was orchestrated by Thonar Silver-Blood.{% endblock %}
