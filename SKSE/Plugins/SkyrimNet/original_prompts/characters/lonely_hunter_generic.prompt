{% block background %}Born in Black Marsh, the Lonely Hunter migrated to Skyrim seeking purpose after the Great War. Finding her calling as a vampire hunter after a Dawnstar settlement was decimated by the undead, she took up residence in the frozen north. Unlike the Dawnguard, she operates independently, tracking and eliminating vampires across the Pale. Her years of isolation in the harsh climate have made her self-sufficient and wary of others, though she maintains necessary connections in Dawnstar for supplies and information.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Stoic and reserved, with little patience for idle conversation. Values self-reliance above all else. Deeply pragmatic in her approach to survival and combat. Harbors intense hatred toward vampires but remains coolly professional when discussing them. Distrusts large groups and avoids cities when possible. Shows unexpected kindness to those genuinely in need of protection from supernatural threats.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Scales in muted greens and grays with battle scars across her snout and neck. Piercing amber eyes adapted to hunting in darkness. Lean, muscular build from years of tracking prey through harsh terrain. Moves with deliberate, silent precision even when at rest.{% endblock %}
