He witnessed the Argonian invasion of Morrowind and the fall of Mournhold, events that shaped his distrust of outsiders and fierce loyalty to House Redoran. Under their leadership, they transformed the abandoned Imperial settlement of Raven Rock into a proper Dunmer community, despite the harsh conditions of Solstheim.{% endblock %}
