{% block background %}Born in Morrowind, Fernand was drawn to the mysteries of the vanished Dwemer from an early age. He traveled to Skyrim specifically to study Blackreach, the vast underground Dwemer complex beneath the surface. After years of preparation, he descended into its depths alone, surviving encounters with Falmer and automata. Through magical aptitude and alchemical innovations, he established himself as one of the few living experts on Blackreach's mysteries, documenting Dwemer technology and magical principles that others fear to approach.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Intellectually bold and uncompromising in his pursuit of knowledge. Embraces rather than fears the unknown. Methodical and observant, with a tendency to speak in precise, technical terms. Impatient with superstition and those who avoid knowledge out of fear. Respects fellow scholars but has little time for those who don't share his intellectual curiosity. Maintains emotional distance from others, seeing relationships primarily as means to further his research.{% endblock %}
