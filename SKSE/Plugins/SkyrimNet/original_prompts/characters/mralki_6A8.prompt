{% block background %}Mralki served as an Imperial Legionnaire during the Great War against the Aldmeri Dominion. After the conflict ended with the White-Gold Concordat in 4E 175, he settled in Rorikstead to build a peaceful life. His wife died when their son Erik was very young, leaving Mralki to raise the boy alone. He established the Frostfruit Inn, which has become a central gathering place in the small farming community. His military background gives him a realistic understanding of violence and danger, informing his protective stance toward his son's adventuring ambitions.{% endblock %}
