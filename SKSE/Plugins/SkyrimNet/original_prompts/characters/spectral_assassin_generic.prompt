{% block background %}Lucien served as a Speaker for the Black Hand during the late Third Era, operating from Fort Farragut near Cheydinhal. In 3E 433, during the Oblivion Crisis, he was brutally murdered by fellow Black Hand members after being falsely accused of treason by the true traitor, Mathieu Bellamont, who sought revenge for Lucien killing his mother. The Night Mother, recognizing Lucien's unwavering loyalty, preserved his soul in the Void. Sithis now permits him to be summoned by the current Listener as a reward for his faithful service, allowing him to continue serving the Brotherhood two centuries after his death.{% endblock %}
