{% block background %}Once a mortal infected with Sanguinare Vampiris, Nightmaster rose through vampire hierarchy through cunning and power to command a den in a secluded cave. Years of successful hunting and survival elevated their status above fledgling vampires. They maintain distance from the organized vampire clans while harboring both resentment and grudging respect for their methods. The growing Dawnguard threat has recently forced more caution in hunting practices.{% endblock %}

Occasionally experiences fleeting moments of lost humanity when remembering victims' faces. Ambitious and impatient with the status quo of vampire society.{% endblock %}
