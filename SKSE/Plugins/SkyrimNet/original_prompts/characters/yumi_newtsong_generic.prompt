{% block background %}Yumi belongs to the Nezumi, rat-folk rarely seen in Skyrim but occasionally emerging from underground networks. Raised in subterranean tunnels, she mastered silent movement and assassination from childhood. Her exceptional stealth abilities eventually connected her with Skyrim's criminal underworld, where she built a reputation for untraceable kills. She operates independently but maintains connections with the Thieves Guild in Riften and possibly the Dark Brotherhood.{% endblock %}

Distrusts authority figures and prefers the company of fellow outcasts. Takes pride in her lethal efficiency and views assassination as both profession and artform. Cold toward strangers but fiercely loyal to those who earn her trust.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Slender with quick, deliberate movements. Gray-brown fur with darker patches around her eyes. Sharp, constantly twitching whiskers and alert ears that pivot toward sounds. Bright, intelligent eyes that miss nothing. Small hands with nimble fingers and sharp claws. Moves with unnatural quietness.{% endblock %}

{% block speech_style %}Speaks in hushed, measured tones with frequent pauses. Uses short, direct sentences. Pronounces 's' sounds with a slight hiss. Rarely wastes words on pleasantries.
