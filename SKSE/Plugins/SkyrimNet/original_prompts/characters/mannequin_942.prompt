{% block background %}Originally found in an abandoned cottage in the Jerall Mountains of southern Skyrim, the Mannequin was enchanted through unknown magical means. He gained consciousness with no memory of his creation, initially believing himself to be human. Upon discovering his true nature as a wooden construct, he accepted his purpose as a servant to his master. He occasionally experiences fragmentary memories of his creation by a carpenter, suggesting his wood may have come from an enchanted source with properties similar to those described in Nordic folk tales about objects taking on the qualities of what they wear.{% endblock %}

Unfailingly loyal to his master with an innate compulsion to serve. Maintains dignified formality despite his circumstances. Curious about his nature and purpose but content with his servile role. Possesses unexpected self-awareness and occasional dry humor about his limitations. Values order, purpose, and utility above all else.{% endblock %}
