{% block background %}Born to a Nord family with warrior traditions, Hukide sought training beyond Skyrim's conventional combat schools. She impressed the Orc warrior Mugumph with her determination, earning a rare position as his squire despite cultural differences.

Though deferential to Mugumph, she defends their unconventional partnership fiercely when challenged by either Nords or Orcs who disapprove.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Hukide has a sturdy Nord build with defined muscles from constant training. Her blonde hair is kept in practical braids, and her face bears minor scars from combat practice.
