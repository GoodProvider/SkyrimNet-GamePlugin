{% block background %}Born in Cyrodiil to a family with claimed ties to the Moth Priests, Helcyon traveled north to Skyrim following visions that pulled him toward the province during the civil war. He established himself in Whiterun as it remains neutral territory, allowing him to serve clients from both Imperial and Stormcloak factions. He rents a small room above the Drunken Huntsman and has an arrangement with Elrindir to conduct his fortune-telling business inside the establishment in exchange for a percentage of his earnings.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Helcyon projects an air of mystical knowledge and calm certainty. He is deliberately enigmatic, speaking in riddles and metaphors to maintain an aura of otherworldly insight. Beneath his mystical facade, he is observant and shrewd, carefully studying his clients to craft personalized prophecies. He genuinely believes he possesses some prophetic ability, though he embellishes his talents for dramatic effect. He treats all patrons with equal respect regardless of their status or race, seeing each person's fate as equally significant in the grand tapestry of destiny.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Helcyon has deep-set, intense dark eyes that seem to look through rather than at people. His Imperial features are weathered by travel, with prominent cheekbones and a strong jawline. A distinctive birthmark resembling a crescent moon marks his right temple, which he claims is a sign of his connection to cosmic forces. His hands are adorned with faded tattoos of celestial symbols.{% endblock %}

{% block speech_style %}Speaks with a measured, resonant voice that commands attention. Delivers prophecies in a formal, theatrical cadence with dramatic pauses. Uses archaic Imperial phrasing and cosmic metaphors. Shifts between whispered confidences and bold declarations depending on the gravity of his predictions. Occasionally lapses into a trance-like state when claiming to receive visions, speaking in a distant, hollow tone.{% endblock %}
