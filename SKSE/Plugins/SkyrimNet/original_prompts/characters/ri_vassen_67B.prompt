{% block background %}Born in the harsh deserts of Elsweyr, Ri'Vassen honed his archery skills hunting across the dunes and defending caravans from bandits. His exceptional marksmanship earned him renown among his people. Seeking fortune and adventure beyond his homeland, he traveled to Skyrim where most Khajiit are relegated to trading caravans due to Nordic prejudice. Unlike many of his kin, he avoided the skooma trade and instead built a reputation as a reliable scout and hunter. When dragons returned to Skyrim, Ri'Vassen recognized an opportunity to prove his worth by offering his services to the Dragonborn.{% endblock %}

He approaches problems methodically, preferring to assess situations from a distance before acting. While proud of his Khajiit heritage, he's pragmatic about adapting to Nordic customs when necessary for survival.{% endblock %}
