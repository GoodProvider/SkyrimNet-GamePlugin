{% block background %}Born to Breton nobility with connections to High Rock aristocracy, Simund secured a position in Count Desilus Carvain's court through family connections and wealth. He purchased his country manor northeast of Bruma to establish himself as a landed noble in Cyrodiil. Recently, he hired the Orc mercenary Dumrag gro-Morrg for protection during a journey, where he became infatuated with Dumrag's wife Atul. Unable to pursue her honorably, Simund arranged her "kidnapping" through local bandits. Atul, already unhappy in her marriage, willingly fled to Simund's manor where they now conduct their secret affair while maintaining his public persona at court.{% endblock %}
