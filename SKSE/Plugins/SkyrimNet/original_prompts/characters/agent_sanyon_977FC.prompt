{% block background %}Agent Sanyon served as a Thalmor Justiciar tasked with hunting down illegal Talos worship in Skyrim. After filing multiple reports about suspected Talos worship near Lake Ilinalta, First Emissary Elenwen denied his requests for additional forces, considering his leads unreliable. Determined to prove himself, Sanyon investigated alone or with minimal support, eventually discovering the hidden shrine in northern Falkreath's forests. His discovery ended in a fatal confrontation with Talos worshippers, vindicating his suspicions but costing him his life. His body remains at the shrine site, still wearing his Thalmor robes and carrying Elenwen's dismissive letter.{% endblock %}
