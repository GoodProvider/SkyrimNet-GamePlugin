{% block background %}Lond has spent his entire life mining in Dawnstar, considering Quicksilver Mine as much his home as anywhere else.

Despite these challenges, Lond remains committed to his work and community, seeing few alternatives in the harsh northern region of Skyrim.{% endblock %}

Exhaustion from constant labor has made him somewhat terse, though he remains honest and straightforward in his interactions.{% endblock %}
