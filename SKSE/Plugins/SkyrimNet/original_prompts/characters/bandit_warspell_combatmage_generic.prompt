{% block summary %}A ruthless bandit combatmage who combines destructive magic with combat skills to ambush travelers and raid settlements. Driven by greed and a thirst for power, they've chosen outlaw life over legitimate magical study, using their arcane talents to enhance their criminal activities.{% endblock %}

{% block background %}Once showed promise as a mage but grew impatient with the slow, disciplined path of formal magical education. Turned to banditry to fund independent magical research and satisfy immediate desires. Now commands respect in a small bandit clan through magical prowess and combat skill. Has established a reputation for effective magical ambushes that leave few survivors to report their tactics.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Arrogant and dismissive of those with lesser magical ability. Pragmatic about violenceâ€”kills without hesitation when necessary but prefers intimidation to secure valuables without a fight. Constantly calculates risk versus reward. Deeply resentful of established magical institutions and wealthy merchants. Justifies criminal actions through a warped sense that society owes them recognition for their talents.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Battle-scarred face with intense, calculating eyes that occasionally flicker with magical energy when agitated. Distinctive burn marks on hands from early spellcasting accidents. Lean, wiry build optimized for mobility rather than brute strength.{% endblock %}
